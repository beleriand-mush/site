<H1>GLORFINDEL</H1>
</CENTER>
<P>The name is in fact derived from the earliest work on the mythology: <I>The Fall of Gondolin</I>, composed in 1916-17, in which the Elvish language that ultimately became that of the type called Sindarin was in a primitive and unorganized form, and its relation with the High-elven type (itself very primitive) was still haphazard. It was intended to mean `Golden-tressed', and was the name given to the heroic `Gnome' (&Ntilde;oldo), a chieftain of Gondolin, who in the pass of Cristhorn (`Eagle-cleft') fought with a Balrog, whom he slew at the cost of his own life.</P>

<P>Its use in <I>The Lord of the Rings</I> is one of the cases of the somewhat random use of the names found in the older legends, now referred to as <I>The Silmarillion</I>, which escaped reconsideration in the final published form of <I>The Lord of the Rings</I>. This is unfortunate, since the name is now difficult to fit into Sindarin, and cannot possibly be Quenyarin. Also in the now organized mythology, difficulty is presented by the things recorded of Glorfindel in <I>The Lord of the Rings</I>, if Glorfindel of Gondolin is supposed to be the same person as Glorfindel of Rivendell.</P>

<P>As for the former: he was slain in the Fall of Gondolin at the end of the First Age, and if a chieftain of that city must have been a &Ntilde;oldo, one of the Elf-lords in the host of King Turuk&aacute;no (Turgon); at any rate when <I>The Fall of Gondolin</I> was written he was certainly thought to be so. But the &Ntilde;oldor in Beleriand were exiles from Valinor, having rebelled against the authority of Manw&euml; supreme head of the Valar, and Turgon was one of the most determined and unrepentant supporters of F&euml;anor's rebellion. There is no escape from this. Gondolin is in <I>The Silmarillion</I> said to have been built and occupied by a people of almost entirely &Ntilde;oldorin origin. It might be possible, though inconsistent, to suppose that Glorfindel was a prince of Sindarin origin who had joined the host of Turgon, but this would entirely contradict what is said of Glorfindel in Rivendell in <I>The Lord of the Rings</I>: most notably in <I>The Fellowship of the Ring</I>, p. 235, where he is said to have been one of the `lords of the Eldar from beyond the furthest seas ... who have dwelt in the Blessed Realm.' The Sindar had never left Middle-earth.</P>

<P>This difficulty, far more serious than the linguistic one, may be considered first. At any rate what at first sight may seem the simplest solution must be abandoned: sc. that we have merely a reduplication of names, and that Glorfindel of Gondolin and Glorfindel of Rivendell were different persons. This repetition of so striking a name, though possible, would not be credible. No other major character in the Elvish legends as reported in <I>The Silmarillion</I> and <I>The Lord of the Rings</I> has a name borne by another Elvish person of importance. Also it may be found that acceptance of the identity of Glorfindel of old and of the Third Age will actually explain what is said of him and improve the story.</P>

<P>When Glorfindel of Gondolin was slain his spirit would according to the laws established by the One be obliged at once to return to the land of the Valar. Then he would go to Mandos and be judged, and would then remain in the `Halls of Waiting' until Manw&euml; granted him release. Elves were destined to be `immortal', that is not to die within the unknown limits decreed by the One, which at the most could be until the end of the life of the Earth as a habitable realm. Their death - by any injury to their bodies so severe that it could not be healed - and the disembodiment of their spirits was an `unnatural' and grievous matter. It was therefore the duty of the Valar, by command of the One, to restore them to incarnate life, if they desired it. But this `restoration' could be delayed<FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="#1">1</A></FONT> by Manw&euml;, if the <I>f&euml;a</I> while alive had done evil deeds and refused to repent of them, or still harboured any malice against any other person among the living.</P>

<P>Now Glorfindel of Gondolin was one of the exiled &Ntilde;oldor, rebels against the authority of Manw&euml;, and they were all under a ban imposed by him: they could not return in bodily form to the Blessed Realm. Manw&euml;, however, was not bound by his own ordinances, and being still the supreme ruler of the Kingdom of Arda could set them aside, when he saw fit. From what is said of Glorfindel in <I>The Silmarillion</I> and <I>The Lord of the Rings</I> it is evident that he was an Elda of high and noble spirit: and it can be assumed that, though he left Valinor in the host of Turgon, and so incurred the ban, he did so reluctantly because of kinship with Turgon and allegiance to him, and had no part in the kinslaying of Alqualond&euml;.<FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="#2">2</A></FONT></P>

<P>More important: Glorfindel had sacrificed his life in defending the fugitives from the wreck of Gondolin against a Demon out of Thangorodrim, and so enabling Tuor and Idril daughter of Turgon and their child E&auml;rendil to escape, and seek refuge at the Mouths of Sirion. Though he cannot have known the importance of this (and would have defended them even had they been fugitives of any rank), this deed was of vital importance to the designs of the Valar.<FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="#3">3</A></FONT> It is therefore entirely in keeping with the general design of <I>The Silmarillion</I> to describe the subsequent history of Glorfindel thus. After his purging of any guilt that he had incurred in the rebellion, he was released from Mandos, and Manw&euml; restored him.<FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="#4">4</A></FONT> He then became again a living incarnate person, but was permitted to dwell in the Blessed Realm; for he had regained the primitive innocence and grace of the Eldar. For long years he remained in Valinor, in reunion with the Eldar who had not rebelled, and in the companionship of the Maiar. To these he had now become almost an equal, for though he was an incarnate (to whom a bodily form not made or chosen by himself was necessary) his spiritual power had been greatly enhanced by his self-sacrifice. At some time, probably early in his sojourn in Valinor, he became a follower, and a friend, of Ol&oacute;rin (Gandalf), who as is said in <I>The Silmarillion</I> had an especial love and concern for the Children of Eru. That Ol&oacute;rin, as was possible for one of the Maiar, had already visited Middle-earth and had become acquainted not only with the Sindarin Elves and others deeper in Middle-earth, but also with Men, is likely, but nothing is said of this.</P>

<P>Glorfindel remaind in the Blessed Realm, no doubt at first by his own choice: Gondolin was destroyed, and all his kin had perished, and were still in the Halls of Waiting unapproachable by the living. But his long sojourn during the last years of the First Age, and at least far into the Second Age, no doubt was also in accord with the wishes and designs of Manw&euml;.</P>

<P>When did Glorfindel return to Middle-earth? This must probably have occurred <I>before</I> the end of the Second Age, and the `Change of the World' and the Drowning of N&uacute;menor, after which no living embodied creature, `humane' or of lesser kinds, could return from the Blessed Realm which had been `removed from the Circles of the World'. This was according to a general ordinance proceeding from Eru Himself; and though, until the end of the Third Age, when Eru decreed that the Dominion of Men must begin, Manw&euml; could be supposed to have received the permission of Eru to make an exception in his case, and to have devised some means for the transportation of Glorfindel to Middle-earth, this is improbable and would make Glorfindel of greater power and importance than seems fitting.</P>

<P>We may then best suppose that Glorfindel returned during the Second Age, before the `shadow' fell on N&uacute;menor, and while the N&uacute;men&oacute;reans were welcomed by the Eldar as powerful allies. His return must have been for the purpose of strengthening Gil-galad and Elrond, when the growing evil of the intentions of Sauron were at last perceived by them. It might, therefore, have been as early as Second Age 1200, when Sauron came in person to Lindon, and attempted to decive Gil-galad, but was rejected and dismissed.<FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="#5">5</A></FONT> But it may have been, perhaps more probably, as late as c.1600, the Year of Dread, when Barad-d&ucirc;r was completed and the One Ring forged, and Celebrimbor at last became aware of the trap into which he had fallen. For in 1200, though he was filled with anxiety, Gil-galad still felt strong and able to treat Sauron with contempt. Also at that time his N&uacute;men&oacute;rean allies were beginning to make strong permanent havens for their great ships, and also many of them had actually begun to dwell there permanently. In 1600 it became clear to all the leaders of Elves and Men (and Dwarves) that war was inevitable against Sauron, now unmasked as a new Dark Lord. They therefore began to prepare for his assault; and no doubt urgent messages and prayers asking for help were received in N&uacute;menor (and in Valinor).<FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="#6">6</A></FONT></P><BR>

<OL>
<LI><A NAME="1"></A>Or in gravest cases (such as that of F&euml;anor) withheld and referred to the One.</LI>
<LI><A NAME="2"></A>Though he is not yet named in the unrevised part of <I>The Silmarillion</I> treating of this matter, it is recorded that many of the &Ntilde;oldor of Turgon's following were in fact grieved by the decision of their king, and dreaded that evil would soon result from it. In the Third Host, that of Finarfin, so many were of this mind that when Finarfin heard the final doom of Mandos and repented, the greater part of that host returned to Valinor. Yet Finrod son of Finarfin, noblest of all the &Ntilde;oldor in the tales of Beleriand, also went away, for Turgon had been elected supreme lord of the &Ntilde;oldorin hosts.</LI>
<LI><A NAME="3"></A>This is one of the main matters of <I>The Silmarillion</I> and need not here be explained. But in that part of <I>The Silmarillion</I> as so far composed it should not be left to appear that Ulmo, chiefly concerned in the coming of Tuor to Gondolin, in any way acted contrary to the Ban, against Manw&euml; or without his knowledge.
<LI><A NAME="4"></A>This implies that Glorfindel was natively an Elda of great bodily and spiritual stature, a noble character, and that his guilt had been small: sc. that he owed allegiance to Turgon and loved his own kindred, and these were his only reasons for remaining with them, although he was grieved by their obstinancy, and feared the doom of Mandos.</LI>
<LI><A NAME="5"></A>No doubt because Gil-galad had by then discovered that Sauron was busy in Eregion, but had secretly begun the making of a stronghold in Mordor. (Maybe already an Elvish name for that region, because of its volcano Orodruin and its eruptions - which were not made by Sauron but were a relic of the devastating works of Melkor in the long First Age.)</LI>
<LI><A NAME="6"></A>For the Valar were open to the hearing of the prayers of those in Middle-earth, as ever before, save only that in the dark days of the Ban they would listen to one prayer only from the &Ntilde;oldor: a repentant prayer pleading for pardon.</LI>
