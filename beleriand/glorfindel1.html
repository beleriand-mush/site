<H1>GLORFINDEL</H1>
</CENTER>
<P>An Elf who had once known Middle-earth and had fought in the long wars against Melkor would be an eminently suitable companion for Gandalf. We could then reasonably suppose that Glorfindel (possibly as one of a small party,<FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="#1">1</A></FONT> more probably as a sole companion) landed with Gandalf-Ol&oacute;rin about Third Age 1000. This supposition would indeed explain the air of special power and sanctity that surrounds Glorfindel - note how the Witch-king flies from him, although all others (such as King E&auml;rnur) however brave could not induce their horses to face him (Appendix A (I, iv), RK p. 412). For according to accounts (quite independent of this case) elsewhere given of Elvish nature, and their relations with the Valar, when Glorfindel was slain his spirit would then go to Mandos and be judged, and then would remain in the Halls of Waiting until Manw&euml; granted him release. The Elves were destined to be by nature `immortal', within the unknown limits of the life of the Earth as a habitable realm, and their disembodiment was a grievous thing. It was the duty, therefore, of the Valar to restore them, if they were slain, to incarnate life, if they desired it - unless for some grave (and rare) reason: such as deeds of great evil, or any works of malice of which they remained obdurately unrepentant. When they were re-embodied they could remain in Valinor, or return to Middle-earth if their home had been there. We can therefore reasonably suppose that Glorfindel, after the purging or forgiveness of his part in the rebellion of the &Ntilde;oldor, was released from Mandos and became himself again, but remained in the Blessed Realm - for Gondolin was destroyed and all or most of his kin had perished. We can thus understand why he seems so powerful a figure and almost `angelic'. For he had returned to the primitive innocence of the First-born, and had then lived among those Elves who had never rebelled, and in the companionship of the Maiar<FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="#2">2</A></FONT> for ages: from the last years of the First Age, through the Second Age, to the end of the first millennium of the Third Age: before he returned to Middle-earth.<FONT SIZE="2"><A HREF="#3">3</A></FONT> It is indeed probable that he had in Valnor already become a friend and follower of Ol&oacute;rin. Even in the brief glimpses of him given in <I>the Lord of the Rings</I> he appears as specially concerned for Gandalf, and was one (the most powerful, it would seem) of those sent out from Rivendell when the disquieting news reached Elrond that Gandalf had never reappeared to guide or protect the Ring-bearer.</P>

<LI><A NAME="1"></A>It may be noted that <I>Galdor</I> is another name of similar sort and period of origin, but he appears as a messenger from C&iacute;rdan and is called Galdor of the Havens. <I>Galdor</I> also appeared in <I>The Fall of Gondolin</I>, but the name is of a more simple and usual form and might be repeated. But unless he is said in <I>The Fall of Gondolin</I> to have been slain, he can reasonably be supposed to be the same person, one of the &Ntilde;oldor who escaped from the siege and destruction, but fled west to the Havens, and not southwards to the mouths of Sirion, as did most of the remnant of the people of Gondolin together with Tuor, Idril, and E&auml;rendil. He is represented in <I>The Council of Elrond</I> as less powerful and much less wise than Glorfindel; and so evidently had not returned to Valinor, and been purged, and reincarnated.</LI>
<LI><A NAME="2"></A>That angelic order to which Gandalf originally belonged: lesser in power and authority than the Valar, but of the same nature: members of the first order of create rational beings, who if they appeared in visible forms (`humane' or of other kind) were self-incarnated, or given their forms by the Valar and who could move/travel simply by an act of will when not arrayed in a body - which they could assume when they reached the places that ... <I>(illegible)</I>.</LI>
<LI><A NAME="3"></A>Galdor in contrast, even in the brief glimpses we have in the Council, is seen clearly as an inferior person, and much less wise. He, whether he appears in <I>The Silmarillion</I> or not, must be either (as his name suggests) a Sindarin Elf who had never left Middle-earth and seen the Blessed Realm, or one of the &Ntilde;oldor who had been exiled for rebellion, and had also remained in Middle-earth, and had not, or not yet, accepted the pardon of the Valar and returned to the home prepared for them in the West, in reward for their valour against Melkor.</LI>
