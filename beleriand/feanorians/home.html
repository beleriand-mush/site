<FONT SIZE="5">I</FONT>t is late at night, and a cold whipping wind blows through the dark lands of 

Thargelion. A thick and eerie fog hangs on the air, cloaking most of the 

landscape. Only the tall and grim form of a grand tower can be seen in the 

south, towering above everything else. Some distance ahead of the stone 

structure, stands a single figure, shadowed by the darkness of night and 

silence and still as a monument, quietly watching...



<p>





As the wind whips through the lands a tent flap is forced aside. A thin flicker 

of light illuminates the front of the tent, which rests at the edge of the 

dwarven encampment. Tulir shakes his head slightly and gazes out first to the 

south then slowly to the north. Moving forward his stiff boots and chain armour 

creak and clink with the khazad's heavy steps. Smoothing his tunic the elder 

priest stops and turns back to gaze upon the camp which his cousins set.

<p>





Olandu stands in the middle of the common ground. The wagon of her party behind 

her and she watches as the other dwarves make ready. She seems to be worried 

until the priest exits his quarters then she smiles and relaxes.

<p>







A figure drops down from one of the khazad travel wagons, and slowly makes his 

way to the fire in the centre. Looking about, he smiles as he sees 2 more of 

his kin dotted around the encampment. Moving slightly, the fire light dances 

around his face and glints off the chain mail hidden beneath a dark cloak. 

Eventually, he moves away and nearer to the female dwarf and elder Priest.

<p>





Milling about the campsite, Argamor turns to look contemptuously upon all that 



he sees. He watches as the elder priest emerges and then turns away, contempt 



in his every move. "Blasted fog.. What we even be doin here? We ain't got 



nothing better to do? Bah, a fools errand with a band of fools is all that I 



get myself into."



<p>





Breg clomps heavily down the steps from one of the dwarf wagons causing it to 



shake and shudder. Reaching the ground Breg turns and sees his kinsmen 



gathering on the edge of the encampment and trods over to them, adjusting his 



polished mail shirt on the way.



<p>







The bitter wind whips down the mountain road, swirling about a small company of 



lightly-clad elves in grey and brown. Their leader, resplendent in purest 



white, trudges at the front, looking up the pass and marking on a tall eminence 



before them. His eyes narrow from time to time as they approach, the plain 



evidence of campfires, and their dispersion, suggesting a situation he might 



not be entirely liking. He turns and murmurs something to the woman walking 



just behind him and then moves ahead again, grimly determined. His teeth set, 



he reaches the base of the prominent castle and notes the variety of folk 



already present, wetting his lips and waiting for the rest of the party to 



arrive.



<p>







The cold, winter wind slaps the faces of an approaching group of Quendi, calmly 



setting their horses to a slow, steady, walking pace as they approach the 



campsites before them. A wagon rolls in the middle of the procession of 



Nargothrondhrim, and a flag bearing Finrod Felagund's seal, waves proudly in 



the air. A lady in the front of the group, slows her horse and raises her hand 



high, and a guard calls, "Halt!", and in reaction, the company stops. The 



guards and those in the front, dismount, but stay by their steeds, and the lady 



removes her grey hood, and takes a few steps forward, surveying the 



surroundings with interested gaze, in silence, as her folk follow suit and 



dismount their own horses. A guard approaches her and the two exchange quiet 



words and the guard departs through the small crowd of Nargothrondhrim, 



organizing and assisting. Telperiel pulls her hair out of her cloak and then 



clasps her hands, almost in an expectant manner.



<p>







From the veiling haze, coming along with the host of the Nargothrondrim, a man 



appears, a Noldo riding on a horse, the dew from the fog causing a silvery 



glint upon its grey body. His pace is slow, churning slightly on the back of 



the animal this elegantly garbed Quende approaches, his head held high, 



vigilantly. At the beckoning, he halts his horse at the front of the host, 



dismounting soon after.



<p>







With slow and methodical movements, a figure cloaked in dark green seems to 



emerge from the small company that travels bearing the seal of Finrod Felagund. 



Coming to stand next to the elleth that set herself apart from the rest of the 



troop. His right hand rests easily at his left side, underneath his cloak, the 



arm crossing the body in front...



<p>











The shadowy and tall figure close to the southern tower finally shows some sign 



of movement. Slowly turning on his back, the wind is now against his cloak, and 



the silver fabric blows wildly, as if it was alive. The strong wind is enough 



to cast aside his hood, and fair Elvish features are revealed, while keen eyes 



regard their surroundings. The imposing and grim man is soon strolling through 



the common ground, approaching the Dwarves. Deep and clear is his voice as it 



echoes, "Greetings, Naugrim. I am sorry I could not be here before." Caranthir 



says with a nod of his head, although his attention is directed to the 



approaching Sindar and Noldor.



<p>







Cloaked and armed with a spear, Bor makes his way to the dwarven camp. He moves 



at a surprising pace, close to a jog. Although he comes from the area near the 



tower as well, he doees not follow Caranthir, but stops a few yards away from 



the assembled elves and dwarves watching them for a moment before he continues 



onward with a grunt.



<p>







Tulir nods his head to the quende. "It is well that you hail us, for here we 



have waited in this cold wind. We are use to our home, as well as this cold. 



Yet we shall not remain longer than needed." Crossing his arms before him, 



Tulir looks over his shoulder in the direction that catches the other's eye. 



His head comes back around to look up at the quende before him, then with a 



gruff voice he adds, "Do ye speak for your kin, or do we wait for others?"



<p>







Olandu moves to stand behind and to the left of the priest not saying a word 



but lending her voice silently to his.



<p>





Moving closer to the small meeting that takes place, Argamor steps past Tulir 



and Caranthir, instead taking note of those that follow the elven lord. 



Watching in silence for a moment, the Khazad snorts loudly before turning his 



back upon them, stomping off to the fire once again.



<p>





Breg passes Argamor and comes to stand on Tulirs right. Looking up he gazes at 



the tall elf lord, thoughtfully stroking his forked beard and nodding to 



himself.



<p>





Vollonwe reaches the edge of the large flattish space and pauses, arriving just 



in time to catch the Noegyth's words to the elves whose heraldry bespeaks 



Felagund. The Basadur squints, examining each of the dwarves in turn, then 



nods, seemingly in satisfaction of some inner query. He waves his folk forward, 



and the small party moves into the area. With another wave, the white-clad elf 



directs the servant elves toward an open spot to one side, to which the 



servants divert, taking the packhorses with them. The rest of the party 



continues forward with Vollonwe who speaks out. "These good folk I feel 



confident can speak for the Lord of the Caves, but tis left for me to speak for 



the Lord of the Forest. Well met, Naugron." He bows slightly, his jaw set 



firmly, his eyes noncomittal, before turning to the Nargothrondrim. Smiling, he 



says, rather more quietly, "Mae govannen, mellyn, and well met, Dorenhir. Tis 



long since our paths crossed and glad we are to see you again."



<p>







Looking to the figure the stands beside her, she smiles and looks over to the 



other camps, her eyes stopping for a moment. She mentions something to him, 



looking at some of the other camps and smiles even more brightly than the first 



time. The guard that had approached her earlier, returns and asks her a 



question. She shakes her head and the guard dissapears once more. The healer's 



eyes turn to the Naugrim and she smiles, but says nothing, awaiting Caranthir's 



reply. "Mae govennan, mellon," the maiden replies to the approaching 



Doriathrim. "It is good to see you," she says quietly, then allows for Bremen 



to speak.



<p>







The long golden hair and the blue cloak now fluttering wildly, and the slack 



white sleeves of the silken undershirt, Electhael strolls by the greeting party 



of the Nargothrondrim, remaining only but little behind the Lady Telperiel, his 



poise erect. The expressionless face becomes a slightly smiling one, just 



enough for one observing him closely to note his benevolence.



<p>







Standing quietly with Telperiel, the Dorenhir casts his hood back as the 



Doriathrim come nearer. Turning to look upon Vollonwe, "Mae govannen Basadur. 



It has been long indeed." Moving over, to grasp his friend, "Glad does it make 



my heart to see the likes of you Vollonwe! Glad indeed."



<p>







Caranthir. nods sternly to Tulir, waving his hand around, "I speak for my own 



men. The Noldor of Thargelion. And you are not the only one who wants to finish 



this in haste. But we must wait for the others... Those coming from Himring at 



my brother's request. But it seems like there are unexpected guests as well." 



he motions towards Vollonwe even while he is approaching and greeting the 



Dwarves and his kinsman, "Have you no manners, Sinda?" echoes his harsh voice 



directed to Vollonwe, as bitter as the grim wind and as cold as the Helevorn, 



"You and your people come into my lands without my knowledge and you act as if 



I was not here? I demand proper greetings and an explanation on why you are 



here." his attention is fully focused on the Sinda, and he fails to hail the 



Nargothrondrim.



<p>



Get the rest from somewhere else ...
