  The Princes of the Noldor
</H1>
<P>
Frequently used abbreviations are listed <A HREF="tolkabbr.html">here</A>.
<P>
The following table lists, as far as can be ascertained, the various names
of the princes and princesses of the Noldor. It will require some
revision/expansion when I get hold of a copy of volume 12 of <CITE>The History
of Middle-earth</CITE>: <CITE>The Peoples of Middle-earth</CITE>.
<P>
The Sindarin name is the name by which the characters are commonly known
in <CITE>The Silmarillion</CITE>. The three Quenya names used by the Eldar
are: the <CITE>ataress&euml;</CITE>, the name given at birth by the father;
the <CITE>amiless&euml;</CITE>, given by the mother, often much later; and
the <CITE>epess&euml;</CITE>, a nick-name mostly given as title of admiration
or honor. The Sindarin name was derived from the most commonly used of the
Quenya names. Although it was not necessarily an exact translation of the
Quenya.
<P>
This table was compiled with assistance from the
<A HREF="http://www2.dcs.ed.ac.uk/misc/local/TolkLang/">Tolkien Language
List</A>, especially David Salo and Edward Kloczko.

  Notes:
</H3>
<OL>
  <LI>
    I have described F&euml;anor, Fingolfin, etc. as the first generation because
    their parents were not, strictly speaking, a generation. The English word
    <CITE>generation</CITE> derives from the Latin <CITE>generare</CITE>, to
    beget. Those that awoke at Cuivi&eacute;nen (Ingw&euml;, Finw&euml;, etc.)
    were created fully grown, so they were not begotten (except perhaps in the
    mind of Il&uacute;vatar). Thus they do not constitute a generation.
  <LI>
    I have included only 'canonical' charcters, i.e. only those mentioned in
    <CITE>The Silmarillion</CITE>. Not the 'apocryphal' ones that appear at times
    in <CITE>The History of Middle-earth</CITE>. For example: Findis, Faniel,
    and &Iacute;rim&euml;, sisters of Fingolfin (<B>HoMe 10</B>); Argon, younger
    brother of Fingon and Turgon (reportedly <B>HoMe 12</B>); Findobar, son of
    Fingon (<B>HoMe 5</B>); and Haldir (<B>HoMe 5 &amp; 11</B>) and Orodlin
    (<B>HoMe 5</B>) sons of Orodreth.
  <LI>
    The naming of Amrod and Amras is reportedly very complicated and will have
    to await my obtaining <B>HoMe 12</B>.
  <LI>
    If only one name is known I am assuming it is the
    <CITE>ataress&euml;</CITE>.
  <LI>
    The Sindarin form of Ilriss&euml; was Ilreth.
  <LI>
    The name Findar&aacute;to is from the Telerin dialect of Quenya, the Noldorin
    form of the name was Artafind&euml;. Remember that Finrod's mother was
    E&auml;rwen of Alqualond&euml;, daughter of King Olw&euml; of the Teleri.
  <LI>
    The naming of Orodreth is very complicated and will have to await <B>HoMe
    12</B>. Orodreth himself is also problematic. In <CITE>The Silmarillion</CITE>
    he is a son of Finarfin, however Tolkien later 'demoted' him. Making him
    a member of the next generation of that same family - i.e. a son of either
    Angrod or Aegnor, but of which one is not stated.
  <LI>
    The name Angar&aacute;to is from the Telerin dialect of Quenya, the Noldorin
    form of the name was Artanga.
  <LI>
    The <CITE>epess&euml;</CITE> Altariell&euml; is said to have been first given
    to Galadriel by Celeborn.
  <LI>
    The name Gil-galad is a Sindarin <CITE>epess&euml;</CITE>, his Sindarin birth
    name was Ereinion. As Gil-galad may have been born in Middle-earth, he may
    not have been given a Quenya name.
  <LI>
    The Sindarin form of the <CITE>epess&euml;</CITE> Taltelemna was Celebrindal.
  <LI>
    Maeglin was born in Beleriand and was given that (Sindarin) name by his father.
    His mother secretly named him L&oacute;mion (Quenya). It is not stated what
    he was called at the Court of Turgon in Gondolin where Quenya was in daily
    use.
