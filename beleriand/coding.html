Here you can find various hints and tips, also basic rules of coding. Basically, all the info to learn coding can be found in Amberyl's MUSH manual, which may be found <A HREF="mushman.html">here</A>.

Puppets are objects which represent animals, non-player-characters, and other similar sorts of creature. Usually these objects have the PUPPET flag set, so that they relay what they see and hear to the player who owns them, though for the purposes of this discussion that is not a requirement.
<P>
Puppets are allowed on this MUSH, with some restrictions:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Puppets cannot be used as combatants, except by special admin approval. Players may RP combat (or anything else for that matter) with puppets if all parties agree (for example, several elves could fight with a warg puppet).<P></LI>

<LI>As a general rule, animals should be considered "ordinary" - your dog or horse is a typical member of the species. Animals should not "talk" or exhibit overly intelligent behavior, nor do they have psychic links to their owners. In particular, puppets may not be used as spy objects. What you see through the eyes of a puppet is not to be considered IC information. Use common sense when deciding what an animal can do - no matter how well you've trained it, a falcon isn't going to fly 500 leagues and pick a random person out of a crowd to deliver a message (on the other hand, a trained homing bird might legitimately travel between two fixed locations).<P></LI>

<LI>Puppets which represent pets should be limited to fairly "standard" sorts of domestic animals, like dogs, cats, horses, etc. They should certainly be chosen as something appropriate to your culture. If you want to step outside these bounds, make sure to clear it with an admin.<P></LI>

<LI>Puppets should not be used in lieu of real characters. For example, if you need to send a messenger from one culture to another, send an actual player if at all possible. Puppets should be used as general NPCs only by special approval.<P></LI>

<LI>Puppets may be used for NPC guards and sentries, heralds, or other forms of "static" character. Usually these are set up by your local admins and are part of the local "scenery" of the location you are in.
<P>
If you are travelling and encounter such a puppet (like a sentry), you should try to determine what culture or player that puppet belongs to, and how to interact with it.<P></LI>

<LI>With the exception of items like sentries, you should make sure to put any puppets you have away before logging off. If you have a horse, you should stable it. If you have a dog, you probably should just pick it up before you disconnect. Don't leave your pet just sitting in a room, especially if that room is a high-traffic area!<P>

You may find it useful to include commands in your @ADISCONNECT which will @teleport a puppet of yours back into your inventory automatically when you disconnect.<P></LI>

<LI>If you have a pet, RP it! Don't just pull it out of your pocket as an occasional prop when you aren't otherwise noted for having one. For example, unless you normally wander around with your hunting falcon, you shouldn't just suddenly have a hunting falcon when it's convenient.</LI>
