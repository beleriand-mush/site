The long, rolling slopes of the Pass of Aglon begin to level off here. Upon the left, the eastern highlands of Ered Gorgoroth loom like forbidding walls of dread. On the right, the cold north wind blows across the unclimable ridges of the Hills of Himring. But, ahead, the way seems to grow easier as the Valley levels, revealing the sparse beauty of this region. Take what heart you can from this realization, for every footstep you take, leads you closer to the lands of the Dark Enemy of the World.

The summer sun beats down on the dwarven encampment, the afternoon sun warm in spite of the altitude. A balzing fire burns in an iron brazier outside the camp, its black smoke wending away across the tops of the tents and wagons. Several dwarves work a large bellows attached to the brazier while another pair, wearing heavy leather aprons, stand around an anvil nearby. One of these, the armorer Kuzadeh, appears to be instructing the other.

"Now lad, the trick of drawing wire is to let the hammer do the work instead of your shoulder". He demonstrates, swinging a heavy hammer down on the glowing metal he holds across the anvil with tongs. The hammer stricks the glowing rod squarely but the smith lets it bounce back a bit and fall again, turning the rod as he does so. The effect is almost to get two strikes of the hammer with a single swing.

An unusually gnarled dwarf, holding his hammer in such a way as to inspire the thought that he may actually strike someone with it, follows his master's suit. Regardless of the outcome, he is unsatisfied, and spits viciously on the ground and growls unintelligibly.

        Nearby, there is a flash of light from the shield of someone who can only be the Deacon Harek. At first, he is walking by the anvil and the two Dwarves there, having come from one of the wagons, no doubt checking on the goods, paying no attention to their work as he murmurs to himself, wiping his brow with a cloth. Yet, he pauses as he hears the words and the hammer falls, glancing over his shoulder to watch, slight interest on his face.


Kuzadeh grunts and brings his hammer down again, repeating the motion for Voyga's benefit. "More like this, the rebound needs to be more controlled". As the ringing of steel on steel dies away he inspects the results and grunts again. You repeat that, over and over, each strike working up the rod, to draw it out until its the thickness you want." Turning deftly he returns the rod to the brazier that is serving as a portable forge and motions for the bellows dwarves to increase their efforts. 

As he turns back he catches sight of the Deacon and raises his chin sharply in greeting, "Ho there cousin. How fare you today?"

Voyga's brows furrow deeply as he continues his task, betraying no sign that the Deacon's presence has altered his efforts.


        "I am well! The wounds have healed nicely, and the journey has been good." The Deacon nods his head to Kuzadeh. "And you, cousin?" A bushy eyebrow is arched as Harek looks to the work of the two armoursmiths. "And what is going on here?"


Kuzadeh surveys the work of his apprentice and nods to himself before commenting, "Voyga is learning to draw wire from barstock for making mail. Its trickier than it might seem to get the hang of." With a glance over his shoulder at the camp he adds, "Have you heard anything about when we may be moving again? Some of the porters are getting restless."

"You motely monkey crew!" roars Voyga, brandishing his hammer. "The forge is cooler than the Enemy's teats!" "Strike harder!" he snarles, bile spewing forth and lingering in the now-tangled beard.

        The Weaponsmith chuckles quietly, nodding slightly. "I see." The eybrow is arched once more, though this time at Voyga's words, before he nods slightly once more. "As to when we may be moving again, I am not sure. I have not heard anything; it has been days since I have shared the Uzbad's company. Of course, I have also been looking after our cargo quite a bit, so I could have missed something. Hopefully, however, it will be soon."

Kuzadeh beams, rather proudly, at Voyga's outburst, "That's it lad. Make them keep their backs in it, you did your turn at that long enough." As the bellows dwarves redouble their efforts he addresses the Deacon again, "Indeed, I hope so as well. I'm told by lord Narag that we are to continue East from here, once this visit is concluded.

Voyga continues his vigil, launching a warning gaze at those working the bellows. His hammer fall punctuates his lord's conclusion. "Something doesn't smell right" he mutters to himself. "Bloody sunlight and woods and SLAGGING DWARVES TO GO WITH IT," lobbing another cinder at his less industrious fellows.

        The Deacon nods. "East, eh? Good. Good. It will be good to head back towards mountains. I do not like this hole in the ground." A jerk of the head towards the Pass; a chuckle comes from Harek, nodding at Voyga. "Good lad."

A runner comes from the camp and approaches Kuzadeh, handing him a letter. The smith reads it quickly and then pulls off his apron, handing it to one of the bellows dwarves. "If you will excuse me cousins, I am summoned to Lord Narag." He bows and hurries along with the messenger but calls back after him, "If you have the time Harek, Voyga still has much he can learn."

 
Voyga nods to his master and turns to the deacon, wiping the sweat from his brow. "Well met, sir" he grates. He turns the hammer in his hands, eyeing it. "It appears that I cannot yell a hammer into doing what I want it to."
        "Farewell, cousin." A slight wave of the hand from the Deacon to Kuzadeh before he nods to Voyga, chuckling softly. "Indeed, hammers do not respond to yelling. If you can handle a hammer well, however, it will respond as you want it. How well do you know that hammer? Do you know the weight of it well?"


Voyga tests the hammer easily in his hands. After a moment, he stops abruptly and intones "I do not". Gripping it more tightly than he has before, Voyga holds his hammer out before him, tilting it, testing it, trying to feel its balance. After a moment, he strikes again, this time less out of anger.

        The Weaponsmith nods. "If you know the weight of the hammer, you know how much force is going to be put into each blow. You will know where to hold it to apply what ammount of its weight, and you can achieve a finer result."

Voyga continues pounding rhythmically, at first with an uneven tempo, but then moving into more causual, measured strokes. The deep crags of his brow fill a little. "So simple", he notes, and adds after a moment's hesitation "Yet perhaps only in thought." At this drifting of attention, Voyga's strike falls with a punctuated clank, clearly not intended. He snaps up his head, and shouts at the crew manning the bellows again, but resumes his measured strokes.
        The Deacon grins, nodding his head. "Good! Good! Find a pattern to fall into when working; for your hammer to fall into. You can form the metal much better this way than with brute strength." A brief glance is sent to the Dwarves working the bellows, eyes narrowing a moment before he looks back to Voyga and his work.


Voyga's pace has a measured smoothness now, and he has become entranced. Staring into the flames of the forge, the apprentice works with what one would never call grace, but fluid efficiency. Not wishing to mar his progress, Voyga keeps his eyes afixed to his work, ignoring the bellow-workers. "If only anger fueled an actual flame!"

        "Quicker on the bellows there!" The words are growled out by the Deacon before he chuckles, nodding. "If that were the case, no forge of ours would ever be cold." A moment of silence. "You have a good pace, one that will serve you well on this work, I think. Keep it. Do not worry about the distractions offered by other things."

Voyga nods gravely in agreement. "And of late, there are many things to be distracted by." His rhythmic pounding continues, this time uninhibited by his intonation.
        "Ay, indeed. When you work the forge... there must be nothing in your mind but what you are working on and the steps required to complete it. If the fire begins to cool, do not take your attention from your work; work out a tapping pattern, perhaps, with those working the bellows. So many taps on the anvil to let them know to work harder, so many taps to let them know the fire is too hot."


The land turns dark as the sun slips behind the horizon in its final descent.
Voyga, encouraged by the Deacon's advice, yells enthusiastically. "Listen you ruttish, pox-marked moldwarps! Two taps means more fire, three means less!" He pauses a moment. "I do not think that you need mind the latter part!"

        A laugh from the Deacon and he nods. "Ay! Indeed, I think they shall not have to worry about the latter. Now, focus on your work. See what you want to make, and use the weight of the hammer and your pattern, to help you achieve what you want. Something that you can show to your master and be proud of."


"A mask", Voyga explains. "My current one flatters me too finely. How can I expect to inspire unwanted emissions when I appear as dainty as our elf-friends?"
        A chuckle from Harek, and he nods. "Indeed, that is true. Armour is not my field, I make weapons after all, but the basics are the same. What you have learned from your master, and what I have taught you, should serve you well in that purpose."

"Many thanks for your advice," Voyga says as he taps twice, spurring increased effort from the bellows. "May our armor blunt all that crosses it, and may your weapons leave only cloven remains of former foes."

        A bow from the Deacon. "Indeed. I have a feeling they will." A slight grin before he moves off, resuming his walk and path from earlier.


Voyga watches the deacon go, nodding his respect, tapping twice furiously.
Voyga has disconnected.
