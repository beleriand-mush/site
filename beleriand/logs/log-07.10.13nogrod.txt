The early morning air is sharp, almost cold, even this far from the mountains. The dwarven camp is dark and virtually silent, except for the stirring of cooks and their helpers near the center. 

But away from the fire, near the smallest and least auspicious tents, a lone figure stalks and paces. A careful observer might notice that other dwarves, clearly trying to be inconspicuous, follow the lone dwarf's pacing. But the watchers make no move to interrupt the lone dwarf's reverie.

Not far from the lone figure, another looms, staring at the ground as if entrenched in dark thoughts. After a moment of consideration, he turns to the lone figure, and salutes him respectfully, but remains silent.

Naugladur acknowledges the salute with a nod. Turning to face the second dwarf he raises his chin, causing the flickering light of the cookfires to flash and dance across the wayward hair of his beard and the polished gems bound therein. "Good morrow to you cousin. It seems I am not alone in my sleeplessness this night."

"Nay my lord", replies the savage-looking other. "My thoughts are troubled and my Axe has dulled. It has been far too long since I have marched, and longer still since I have bled."

Naugladur chuckles, "Ahh the eagerness of youth. We march to the very brink of lands overrun by the foulest of the yrch. Careful of the mention of bleeding, lest you find yourself with a surfeit of it." The uzbad, his mmod seemingly lifted by the exchange, places a hand heavy with rings on the second dwarf's shoulder. "Come then cousin, give me your name. I would speak to some of my counselors of you, they seem uncertain that a proper fire remains in the hearts of the dwarves of Nogrod."

"I am Voyga", replies the other, his eyes ablaze. "And if fire is needed, call upon me." His intonation recalls the grating of a tomb-slab.
The sun rises over the horizon in the distance, illuminating Arda once again.

Naugladur raises a hand and draws his fingers through his beard thoughtfully. "I shall remember you Voyga. May you find the battle you seek, and not find it more than you expected." With a nod at one of the furtive dwarves in the shadows, who turns out to be one of the white-clad royal guard, the king moves away through the tents and wagons, though with an easier step that had marked his progress before the chance meeting.

Voyga watches him go, gravely saluting, and wonders.
