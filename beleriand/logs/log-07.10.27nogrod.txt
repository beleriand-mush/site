The Pass of Aglon
The Pass of Aglon stretches away into the north and south, allowing passage
from Lothlann to Himlad. This canyon appears washed from the hard stones of the
Hills and Mountains, as if a mighty river had, at one time, flowed through.
Now, the winds from the merciless north howl and shriek through its length, a
lonely sound of wailing dispair and anguish.
 On the right, the hill-slope has been smoothed into a ramp leading to a tall
Tower of the Noldor. Many lights of various hue shine out and down from the
windows of the structure. There can be no doubt that a watch is maintained on
the Pass of Aglon from this very tower.

Obvious exits:
 Southwest leads to South Passage of Aglon.
 North leads to North Passage of Aglon.
 East leads to Before Til-Lome.

It's a cold and cloudy afternoon as the sound of wagon wheels are heard
approaching from the southwest, accompanied by grunts of labour and toil. Soon,
a short, grey-bearded figure is seen cresting the hill-slope--the object of
some of the grunting, although the only visible toil is his labouring up the
hill. Behind him can be seen some others of his kind. "Come, lad, soon ye can
rest," says the leader to a younger (for a Dwarf), red-bearded one who is
pulling a heavily-laden wagon behind him.

        Glancing up from the afternoon's smokey horizon, for fires burn as
embers are tossed upon the air like leaves in the Encampment of the
Princes, the Herald of Celegorm stands nigh the breach of tents and
saddled steeds.

        "Here they come," Earen murmurs, her tone flat-- riders and servicefolk
ceasing their rituals in this place, to wonder on the approach.

        The Princes are at rest, or at toil, but within their own tents they
remain; the task of greeting the Dwarves is left to her then, and she
walks but a few paces ere her steps tarry entirely and stop. She waits,
her arms folded across her chest.

Nekozar draws the wagon to a stop, letting the handles drop to the ground at
his side. He draws up to his whole height, chest puffed out broadly, at the
sight of a tall elf standing proudly.
Nekozar says, "I could draw that wagon for miles yet, Master Dror!" Nekozar
says with bravado, his breath heavy from toil."

        One of the Dwarves, walking behind the gray beard and off to the side
of the wagon, is the Weaponsmith and Deacon Harek. Both his arms are
resting in front of him, hands in the sleeves of his robes. He is
quiet, for the moment, eyes flicking to the Elf for a moment before a
short frown and snort comes from him.

Paying the Elves no heed at all for the nonce, Dror chuckles heartily and pats
Nekozar on the back with gusto. "Well done indeed, laddie. Now come help me tap
this cask of wine. 'Tis a rare cold afternoon for a summer, eh? Some, see to
starting a fire. I be thinkin' mulled wine!"

Surely the sounds of the approaching wagons are not lost upon the keen ears of
the healeress Iherinwen, and surely the words of Earen do not fall upon deaf
ears. She rises from her place upon one of the logs by the fires, and soft and
swift are her footsteps as she comes to stand behind the Lady-Herald, perhaps
seeming to peer over her shoulder at the nearing dwarves. "Shall I alert my
Lord, milady?" she queries, her voice softened as her wont.

        Earen's brows raise, her wrath is aimed at a rider nearby. "Get off
your behind! Even the good Lady Healer has more mind to stand in the
presence of visitors arrived-- be they bearded or otherwise!" she
hisses, eyes wild with ire. The rider obliges, and swiftly, his feet
find themselves supporting him upright.

        At the words of the aforementioned Healer, the Herald turns her head--
regarding her with gentle care. "Not yet," she says, her timbre even
and soft-- as it ever is, with Iherinwen.

        "I think they mean to set up camp here, and I would learn their purpose
ere accosting the Prince's with such matters." Though, she would
expect, a greeter from the Dwarven party to come forth.

As Harek walks behind Dror, an acolyte follows the Deacon. Though his clothing
is not as formal (instead it seems rather comically), his visage is set as
serious and his head is bend somewhat.

For those who know him, a rather uncharacteraristic silence for the Dwarf
Rulbi.

Nekozar takes a long draught from Dror's wine skin, and passes the skin on to
Harek. "Mulled wine, indeed!" Looking longingly at the finery the elves are
clad in, Nekozar quietly adds, "Perhaps we should invite these elves to partake
as well? The more the wine, the more likely they may be to part with some of
those gorgeous gems I see upon their fingers..."

Several younger Dwarves clad in dark tabards and breeches hop at Dror's
command, with Dwarven skill quickly kindling a small fire. Nor does Dror
hestitate to himself tap the cask. Soon, a pot is filled with wine and is being
heated over the fire. Dwarven wagons, beasts of burden, and various sacks and
bundles are unceremoniously piled here and there, and the Dwarves begin to get
talkative and even rowdy, gathered about the fire. "Aye, young Nekozar. P'raps
the Elves will join us!"

"But are you sure we should not say aught, even now? Surely my Lord's brother
shall be wroth if he finds them camped nearby without his knowing..." The words
are nigh whispered, even softer than the wont of the elven healeress; perhaps
therein there is also a touch of concern. Grey are the eyes that slip between
Earen and the dwarves, a slight frown writing itself upon her expression, a
sort of worry found there. And, for a brief moment, she glances backward toward
the tents of the Princes.

        The Deacon shakes his head slightly at the wine, turning rather to
regard the Acolyte behind him. "You seem rather quiet, Rulbi...
something wrong?" A bushy eyebrow is arched a moment before he pays
attention once more to his fellows around him. "Did no one bring ale?
Wine is fine, but ale is better on a cold evening, I have found..."

        The Lady of the Hunt... watches. That is all she does. Perhaps there is
a mark across her visage that would indicate suprise, but she herself
betrays such not willingly. Swift is the shadow of disagreement, again,
though it is brewing beneath the surface and shown only in grey eyes.

        "Would they honestly mean to set up camp so close without so much as a
gesture of informing us?" Her words are spat, through her teeth, which
are gritting themselves together ere another poor rider find the mark
of her wrath.

        Alas, too late.

        Pulling a rider by the scruff of his cloak, Earen seeths-- her words
hissed into his ear. "Get over there and ask them who among them is
herald, or able to speak for the King, and that he should with curtesy,
speed his approach to Celegorm's Herald for entreaty."

        A breath retreats the Green Knight, her eyes sharply follow Iherinwen.
"Aye, the Princes need be informed-- they are on a hunt, though. Best
as I might, I am left to deal with this."

Nekozar says, "Master Dror, surely that tall dwarf yelling at the others is the
one in charge. P'raps I should invite her and some of her folk to join us in a
cup or two? Then we can get down to business!"

"Hah, ale beats wine any time of day." Rulbi suddenly barks -- not offending,
but he's just loud. "I'm sure there must be some around, Master Deacon." He
glances at the horizon and scowls. "As orcs and other foul creatures. It seems
we're only getting closer and closer to the Enemy on this mission." He shrugs
then though. "My silence was a prayer to Mahal; that He has granted the world
this canyon."

Dror nods to Nekozar, rubbing his hands together. "Aye, go fetch me a Noldo or
two, that we may fill their bellies with this Southern wine that I have gone to
so much trouble to bring," he says, a bit loudly. "Ale for the brethren, coming
right up!"

Nekozar walks up to the apparent leader of the elves, and bows. "Good day,
Mistress Elf. M'name's Nekozar, purveyor of fine gems and jewelry. I and the
dwarves I am with are journeying about seeking to find profitable trading
ventures. Perhaps m'lady and her friend there behind you would care to join us
round the fire in few glasses of fine wine?"
<OOC> Dror says "Someone want to fill Calestel in on the poses so far?"
<OOC> Earen can do.

Alas, too late for the poor rider who happened to be standing nearest to Earen.
"A--Aye!" he calls, his voice perhaps shaking for the lady-herald's ire. When
she releases him, he adjusts his cloak and straightaway his footfalls approach
where the dwarves have gathered. He stops perhaps abruptly, and straightens his
bearing, bowing toward the visitors, lest he be scolded later by Earen again.

And then he gathers his courage, yet shaken due to his close encounter with the
Lady-Herald. "The Lady Rindisil, Herald of the Lord Celegorm, requests that you
send with all haste your lord's herald, that she might speak with him..."

The eyes of Iherinwen widen at Earen's reaction, and she lifts a hand slightly
as if she would try to stay the herald's violence, although she fails. The
words of the approaching dwarf startle her, and she looks to Earen, waiting.

        The Deacon arches an eyebrow again, looking to the Acolyte. They narrow
a moment before he nods, a hand coming out from under a sleeve to
scratch his chin. "Very good, Rulbi. Though, I would not worry about
the Enemy. Let him come against us, and we shall teach him that Dwarves
are not easy to defeat."

        He falls silent, then, watching Nekozar go towards the Elves before
looking to Dror. "Not that I mean to cast any insult on your wine, it
is just ale is my prefered drink." A wide grin from Harek. "Never
developed much of a taste for wine."

Dror chuckles at the words of the rider. "No need to stand on ceremony here,
friend. Here ye go... Finest Dor-winion vintage." He hands a mug to the rider,
and winks over at Harek, then returns to his speech. "No lords here, only
humble traders, plying only the finest quality wares!" He clears his throat.
"Now, what be your fancy?"

        Earen's eyes follow the rider, and were there need of a fire kindled,
it might be started from the narrow gaze that follows at his back. As
he speaks, the Herald notes the arrival of one of the Dwarves--
glancing down on him-- a brow immediately raised. She looks backward to
Iherinwen, blinking, before back to Nekozar.

        "Why, that sounds simply grand," comes the Lady-Herald's words; though
they are laced with a hiss. "Tell me something, Master Nekozar; how
long might you and your little band of merry Dwarves be entreating with
those of Feanor's Followers?"

        For those who would know Earen, and know her well-- they would start to
back away, the hills or hiding places in tents and beneath horses,
seeming fair to them-- for she is about to deliver swift tongue-lashing
should the answer not befit her question.

Nekozar laughs heartily, "Why, we shall only be here long enough to trade some
of our finery, and perhaps a little longer if we find the company suits us!
Now, come Lady Elf! To the fire! I see one of your company has already begun to
partake of our hospitality!" Taking another longing look at the gems adorning
the elves, Nekozar turns and begins walking back the other dwarves.

The mention of ale, make Rulbi's eyes shine. "After a day of travel, little is
better than a good mug of ale!" He bellows, with a wide grin.

"I, in no way, ment to doubt our skills or courage, Master Harek." He notes
then. "But it seems to me these Elves are begging for trouble..." He glances at
their camp a moment, then his eyes venture further, into the pass. His eyes
narrow a moment, as were he to see a mirage -- one that finds his fancy, for he
explains it. "A great wall could be build here. Covering the pass as a dam. A
mighty defensive structure."

The rider does not seem to know what has happened, as he suddenly finds himself
with a mug in his hand. He blinks, perhaps unsure of what to do, now that he
seems to be at a standstill where carrying out Earen's orders is concerned. He
turns his eyes back toward Dror, and if there is anything to be read within his
expression, it is worry... indeed.

"You have no herald?" he says, utterly disappointed. "But you must have someone
that will speak with my Lord's herald...?"

If anything, Earen seems angry, and perhaps the healeress yet wishes to stay
her anger. For she does not back away, neither does she hide; then, she must be
brave, indeed. Iherinwen reaches out a hand toward the arm of the lady-herald,
her greyed gaze flickering to Nekozar before it, swift, returns to Earen.
"Milady..." If she would say more, it is unvoiced; perhaps she begs the herald
to have patience?

        "You would think they would have done that, would you not Rulbi? To
leave this place open is so... foolish and dangerous. Ah, well. As long
as their trade is good, it does not bother me how they choose to live."
The Deacon shrugs his shoulders, adjusting his robes slightly. "After
all, we do not live here."

"I myself used to prefer ale, indeed," Dror chats with the priestly folk. "I
was proprietor of an inn in Nogrod long before I took up trading wine. But I
came upon this stuff in my travels in the south. Rare good stuff, it is, and
these Elves from over the sea do so take to it. Reminds 'em of the West, so I'm
told."

        Earen steps to her side, for well did she see the Lady Healer's hand
coming to her arm-- to quell her, and it does breach the bounds of her
raiment, yea, but it does not still her. She walks around the Dwarf,
quiet, her lips forced into a firm line. At the mentioning of another
elf who has taken drink at the new residence of the travelling Dwarven
Encampment, the elleth's eyes dart to him. And she is little pleased.

        "Master Nekozar, there are certain things that must be done in order
for us to enjoy eachother's company," the Lady-Herald utters, the word
'enjoy' being spat as if a foul-tasting berry. "As well as your folk
are donned and deemed for merriment within your host, such cannot be
afforded in this vale by those who follow the Prince's, the Sons of
Lord Feanor. So you will forgive my next..."

For a moment, Rulbi looks longingly at the pass and sighs. Then he turns away
and takes a moment to produce two mugs of ale. One he hands silently to Harek,
his noble, from the other, he drinks deep. "Nay, we do not live here." He then
says. "And for that we can be glad."

He turns then to Dror. "Reminding of East or South or West." He shrugs. "It is
foolish. A drink is to quench thirst." To strengthen his words, he brings his
mug again to his lips and empties it.

        The Deacon laughs, taking the mug of ale from Rulbi and taking a deep
drink from it before nodding. "Ay, we can be glad indeed. Would not
imagine why anyone would want to live here. I mean, look at it." A hand
is waved at the pass before Harek looks to Dror, an eyebrow arching.

        "Oh, indeed? I would hope there is good money in the wine, if it is
rare stuff. I imagine you can fetch a high price from the Elves if it
reminds them of the West."

With the Elf standing firmly before him (and talking just as firmly as she
stands), Nekozar stops in his tracks. Beneath his red bangs he peers up at the
Lady Elf through squinted eyes. "M'lady, in Dwarf society it is considered
highly impolite to refuse hospitality warmly given. Now then," Nekozar
continues, putting his hands on his hips, "If you're not in charge here, then
either send forth the proper Elf or come sit in until the proper Elf arrives!"

His temper beginning to rise, Nekozar continues. "And, it is also impolite to
not give one's name! Shall I continue calling you 'Lady Elf'?"

The faintest of sighs falls from the lips of Iherinwen as the lady-herald's
wrath remains uncalmed and unchecked. "Milady, perhaps 'tis that they do not
know manners..." breathes the healeress; and this is an attempt to save Nekozar
from Earen's wrath? It is weak at best, though sincerely given. And though she
tries to use her words to stay the lady-herald, her visage perhaps betrays that
she feels rather helpless in the situation.

Meanwhile, there is another who seems to be feeling helpless as well, for the
rider yet stands by the dwarven wagons, unmoving, nigh unblinking. He does not
drink from the mug in his hand, but merely looks at it. Perhaps he is unsure,
or perhaps he is frozen for some impending doom he fears must be approaching
him, and swiftly.

The afternoon sun, such of it as filters down to the pass through the cloud
cover, may not hold much warmth but it does provide vivid flashes as it
reflects from the polished equipment and sparkling jewelry that adorns the
group of dwarves now moving up the pass. The majority of them are dressed in
the white and silver of the royal guard of Nogrod, but another group wends its
way up the pass some distance behind the first.

At the head of the leading group walks a dwarf of obviously high status. His
torso is draped in fine silver-washed mail set with rubies, diamonds and
onyxes. As he moves along theroad his beard, a rich a fiery red, is teased by
the breeze so that it looks like dancing flames amid the glint of sunlight that
flash out, now and then, from the jeweled beads worked into its braids.

        All sembalance of patience, what little fleeting patience she had, that
is, is gone. As is common with the folk of Feanor, those who have seen
the lands of Valinor, fire is quick to raise-- and this fire, unlike
the others, will not be quelled. "I -am- in charge here!" she belts
out, fair of face but terrible of voice, wicked does her expression
reign.

        "In the name of the Prince Celegorm, I am his Lady Herald, and you will
WATCH thy tongue, base-born dweller in holes and dirt and caverns of
beraggled stone!"

        Earen seethes, bearing down upon the Dwarf who would dare to question
her. "You are -well- warned to take ye, and ye folk, and depart this
place; lest I make swift passage of you and them, in your inability.
Get ye gone!" Her wrath rages further then, foot-falls taking her off
at speed and steady stride toward the Rider of the Followers-- her
hands clenched tightly. He is well-learned to fear an impending doom--
and it comes wearing the colours of Celegorm.

        Without hesitation, Earen moves to take hold of the Rider by the back
of his collar-- her coming unseen, and quiet, and quick. A gloved hand
would grasp whatever she could-- hair, cloak, leather and armour, and
she pulls-- Hard. "Manners are but one thing!" Earen booms back in the
direction of Iherinwen, as she attempts to drag the Rider backward.
"But besmirch the Lady-Herald of Lord Celegorm? Wrath greater than this
has been earned this day!"

        To the Dwarf who would learn her name, she says nothing-- though her
eyes flicker to him, and no love rests therein for his humour.

Helfdan arrives with some other dwarves, carrying supplies, shortly after the
group of royal guards, straightening his posture, he asks "where shall we put
these, Uzbad?"

Nekozar's fiery red bear bristles at this sudden outburst. "Herald you may be,
and Elf you may be, but Lady? Such a title shall be reserved for those who know
to act in decent company, not for those such as yourself who would treat a
noble Dwarf thusly! Lady Elf? Bah! You are clearly nothing but an Elf Lady!"

Negabani intercepts the eager porter that addressed the king and directs him
towards the wagons up ahead. The king, for such is the regal figure who leads
the first group of dwarves advancing up the pass, takes no notice of the
question.

As the royal party reaches the environs of the stopped wagons Negabani stops
and looks around. Arriving in time to hear Nekozar's statement, an odd
expression, one that might be amusement, twists the whiskers around his stern
mouth.

Dror, red-nosed and swaying, rises from his seat at this point and waves a mug
in the air, adding his crusty voice to the din. "All we wanted to do was offer
some wine!" He staggers up to Earen and thrusts a half-drunk mug up towards
her, sloshing red wine all over the hapless rider.

As the herald rambles off her wrath to the dwarf, insults and all, the
healeress seems mortified, unable to intervene, unable even to speak further.
And as Earen grabs the Rider and yells back toward her, perhaps Iherinwen seems
to cower at her words, and a soft step she takes backward toward the tents, and
her grey eyes turn downard.

The Rider fares little better, for his doom comes swiftly, in ire and wine. For
he is pulled sharply by Earen on his cloak, and gasps, startled by the
combination of his silent thought and the suddenness and silence of the
lady-herald's approach. And if this were not bad enough, the mug that he had
been holding is loosed by the jarring pull of Earen. Yet his troubles are not
over, for Dror's mug is spilled on him then. "Milady..." he pleades as he is
dragged.

"Is that what happens when they are reminded of the West?" Rulbi beholds the
rider this with rissen eyebrows, he has produced another mug of ale and drinks
from it readilly. "He just seems... stunned." And then... the rider is suddenly
pulled away. The full mug he carried is spilled. The acolyte speaks -- in his
usual loud manner, his booming voice reach far indeed. "Oy, she just ruined his
drink. A gift giving out of hospitality! Wonder if she'll pay for that?"
Clearly, he is refering to Earen. "It's no cheap wine, that!"

And besides it all, the King approaches. Unnoticed, at least by Rulbi.

Negabani clears his throat, at a nod from the king, and bellows out in a
resounding baritone, "Here now! What's this waste of wine about?" Behind him
the king's guards, five of them, fan out to get a better view. Negabani looks
to Dror for an explanation but cants his head to one side as the wine
merchant's condition becomes apparent.

        At the shouting, the Deacon frowns, downing the rest of his ale before
setting the mug aside, laughing quietly, glancing to Rulbi. "I would
hope so. If all the Elves are like her," This is said in such a manner
by Harek and with a gesture towards Earen that he doubts that choice of
word as appropriate. "I can say they will not be getting much business
from me..."

        At Negabani speaking, however, the Deacon turns, eyes narrowing a
moment as he sees the herald... and the guards, and then the King. A
momentary blink before a slight bow of the head is given; then he looks
back to the Elves.


        Dragging the rider behind her, Earen strides back to the company of the
fair Healeress, Iherinwen-- though her ire is now fully alight and none
might be safe from it. The copper-haired elleth drops the rider on his
face at the feet of the Healer, the Herald striding past her to
retrieve something not too far away.

        All the while, she has said nothing, while insults have been hurled at
her as to her standing, and her lady-like attributes and demeanor,
which only work to rile her further. Though she does hear a familiar
voice on the air, turning of a sudden in her stride to behold Negabani
of the Dwarves.

        "Is this how your folk would generally ensue trade, Negabani, Herald?"
she yells, eyes set upon him. "Hurling insults, and making themselves
quite comfortable before seeking to treat with the Lords here? Is this
the measure of the Dwarves?" She laughs then, wildly; holding off
retrieving the spear with which she had intended to puncture the wine
barrels; her stance demanding Negabani's answer.

The glint of gems and metal catches Nekozar's eye. He turns to see Negabani,
herald of the king, walking forward in his fine array. He turns to the Elf.
"Elf lady, it would appear that the herald of my king has arrived. A timely
arrival I would think, for your sake. May I suggest that you deal with him in a
more polite manner than I was dealt with!" Nekozar turns and walks back to the
fire, taking another cup of wine. He pulls a pouch from beneath his cloak and
begins to examine several small gems, seemingly oblivious to the world around
him.

You sense: Dror gestures, "Foolish Elves, they think a Dwarf can get drunk so
easily!"

You sense: Nekozar gestures, "Foolish and rude."

Seeing his liege, Dror turns even redder, and stumbles off to the side, mumbles
an inarticulate apology, and collapses behind his wagon. A soft snoring sound
can be heard throughout the rest of the afternoon.

You sense: Naugladur gestures, "I will handle her impertinence."

"Yes, Master Harek. Such manners are uncalled for in trade!" It seems the ale
has only strengthened the volume of Rulbi's voice. "And she even are say we
cast insults her way! Nay, we've been naught but hopital!" He shakes his head,
not understanding, his beard --and even some of his large belly -- swaying
along. "The only one I heard calling out insults, 's that elf! Hah!"

Naugladur steps in front of Negabani, who bows deeply and allows the king to
take over. Naugladur's eyes show a fire that nearly matches his beard. As his
right hand, the fingers heavy with rings, twines the hair of his mustache in an
annoyed gesture he considers the scene before him. He stalks heavily towards
the healeress and the downed rider and looks over both before speaking.

When he does speak, the king's voice is quiet, though by no means soft. He
addresses himself to the Herald, "Lady Herald, my folk are guests in the lands
of your lord. That should guarantee better treatment than this spectacle would
seem to indicate." He glances at where Dror and Nekozar have retired behind the
wagons. "I am unduly fond of master Dror's wares myself and it grieves me to
seem them so poorly disposed of."

The land turns dark as the sun slips behind the horizon in its final descent.

        The Herald doesn't move from her spot, though she does look upon the
King that would speak, addressing her. The smirk on her face is
twisted, but she does find him terribly amusing. "You are late arrived;
and have not seen what has gone on at the hands of your... people." Her
head is nodded, with disgust, in the direction of the drunk Dwarves and
their bellies full of wine-- Earen not hiding her distaste for them.

        "You indeed, are guests in this land-- and I would thank ye, and ye
ilk, to remember it; of you, or your Herald, I have not encountered
anything less than respect-- perhaps some of this you should impart
upon your swarthy folk there." Her tone is even, though it is still
threaded with ribbons of annoyance, and she pays no heed to the fallen
rider or the Healeress for the moment.

The Rider is cast at the feet of Iherinwen, and the healeress straightaway
kneels beside him to help him up and perhaps to see if the lady-herald has
dealt him any considerable injury in her wrath. But it is then that the dwarven
King nears, and looks upon her and the rider, and her eyes widen, perhaps in
some form of surprise.

And though, based on earlier situations, it would perhaps be normal of
Iherinwen to look to Earen while she speaks, her grey eyes do not move farther
than Naugladur. Instead, they turn back to the fallen rider, who perhaps seems
far more shocked than she.

Rulbi was so intently beholding this curiously behaving Elf -- and bellowing
loudly, not to forget -- that he did not notice the Kings arrival, despite the
large group accompanying him. But when he does, the Engineer quickly bows his
head deep, out of respect. And the serf of loud manners is quiet, to let
Naugladur speak. He follows the conversation, while working down yet more ale.

The king snorts, as if in surprised amusement. With a gesture of his hand that
takes in the dwarves that remain present from the earlier incident he says, "I
am acquainted with some of these 'swarthy folk' and know them to be fine and
capable. Of the character of Master Dror, I am as certain as I am of my own.
Perhaps it would be best if you, or one of your, hrmm, willowy, folk could
explain to me what these dwarves could have done to warrant such harsh words as
I heard on my approach." He glances at the rider before adding, "I care little
of how you treat others, but my people are just that, and an affront to them I
will consider nothing less than an affront to me."

Another draws near, softly clinking in mail that shines gold; a scabbard rides
carelessly at his side. This one is far from willowy, and he moves quietly
forward.

A bare hand comes near Iherinwen's shoulder -- bright, hard eyes glance at the
king with the beard and eyes of fire. "What has happened?" Alahasto whispers.

        "Consider it what you will, King," Earen replies, unmoved. "I care
not."

        "Your folk would seek to set up their camp within the confines of my
Lord's, without invite, without consideration, and without explaining
their intent. Though this was not their error-- for such can be
forgiven from the uncooth." The Lady-Herald chooses her words carefully
as usual (even if they are abraisive), continuing. "However, when I
tried to explain such need of processes to your Jewelsmith, and also
send one of my riders to entreat time with you or your Herald, neither
you nor he could be found. In my face he would scorn our meger
requirements, and call me rude. Still, this could be forgiven for the
aforementioned reasons of lesser-fine company." Earen smiles, one of
her hard, cold, smiles.

        "Greater insults have I, and the folk of Feanor, endured-- at the hands
of mightier callers; but within these lands, it would be wise for you
to acknowledge that these are not the caves of your habit, and such
things are not so easily forgiven, especially when offered in what
little patience I have. Nekozar and his band of merry Dwarves would
seek to lay slur upon the name of Earen? They lay slur upon the name of
Prince Celegorm, and all us 'willowy' folk. For less have those who
would seek to do such, even among the Noldor, have found swift
reprisal."

        Earen notes the arrival of Alahasto, her eyes briefly moving to him.
"So I say again, King; remember which lands thee are in, and in who's
company thee wish to treat. And I will be done with it, and tell my
Lord of your... move, closer to our camp; for you think harsh words are
uttered from me? His shall be worse, and more terrible for your
unannounced arrival."

The attentions of the healeress are then focused upon the poor rider, and she
glances over him quickly. Yet, she is interrupted when the hand touches her
shoulder, and she looks up to find none other than Alahasto. And that grey gaze
that she casts toward him is wide, indeed, and perhaps even sorrowed beside.

"'Tis Lady Earen..." she breathes, words far quieter than her wont. And perhaps
little more explanation is needed, for the lady-herald has spoken again. Surely
Alahasto might hear her words for himself and discern what has come to pass?

The smoldering fire that had lit the dwarf-king's eye flashes into leaping fire
at the herald's words, however carefully chosen they may have been. His ringed
hands clench into fists and, as his knuckles grow pale from the tension of his
own grip, the white-clad dwarves behind him take on a trace of a similar
tension. His voice is still quieter now, than it was before, but a sharp and
stony harshness marks his words as he clips off each one as if biting back
others that might be ready to spill forth, "Summon your prince then, elf.
Summon all the Sons, if you see fit. But let me remind you as you do so that I
sent ahead of my coming and received words of welcome in return. My people are
guests. Guests who have been afforded the welcome of this land." Here he pauses
and takes two deliberate steps toward Earen, his right hand unclenching and
falling to hang perilously close to the gleaming sword at his hip, "Regardless
of what has passed here before my arrival, your words to me, you arrogant
whelp, are not to be borne. Forget not the service my folk have done you.
Forget not the fine weapons that our forges have spilled forth to aid you in
your wars. Did I not see the work of Telchar, my kinsman, on the belt of Prince
Curufin not three days past?"

Naugladur relaxes his hands, with obvious effort. But while the right hand
wanders back across his body and away from the sword hilt, the left comes to
rest on the leather frog that holds that sword.

        The Lady-Herald... laughs.

        Her laugh is bright, brighter than it's usual keen-- her shoulders
slightly bobbing as mail beneath her tunic jingles, and her longsword
sways with the motion. "You sent ahead of your coming, yea," she
murmurs-- another chuckle escaping her as she quite happily laughs in
the face of the Dwarven King. "And you indeed, are guest--" here, her
demeanor shifts, her visage betrays a danger of a swift wrath
approaching. "You are not guest in -this- Encampment, and have no leave
to be here, for you have not requested leave to be within." She pauses,
her smile bright and fair. "Though if you wish to request leave to have
your camp next to that of the Sons, I shall see that the Prince's will
hear it-- and decide for themselves the merit of such an arrangement."

        Being called a whelp does not phase the elleth, poor insults from
little Kings, though she cannot stiffle another laugh at the advance of
Naugladur, with hand hovering at miniature-sword of his wield. "Quickly
you forget that this service is not one-sided, King," comes her quip,
her head canting to the side. "For well do we know, in this camp, that
the Dwarves do nothing for the kindness of their heart-- and we do not
expect such. What you see hanging where, be it upon Stone folk, or fair
Prince, is not my concern-- but make not the illusion that you rest
here of merit to your spirit. Because you do not."

The king resumes something of the quieter demeanor he had shown before his
outburst of anger, though clear evidence simmers in his eyes to show that it is
merely contained and by no means banished. His gaze settles firmly on the elf
woman's eyes. With a smile on his weathered features he intones, "Neither
should you forget that you face not a simpering king of the Edain, in awe of
your grace or your age, but a king of dwarves. You claim to know us well, in
this camp. Consider the worth of our ire to the schemes of your princes. I will
not be cowed by a herald who's estimation of herself outstrips her reach."
Then, with a glance at the gold clad knight and the healer, the king very
deliberately turns his back on the herald to address his own people, "Deacon
Harek, what would you counsel in this matter? You were here to witness it from
its begining, no?"

        The Deacon is silent for some moments before speaking, nodding his
head. "Ay, I saw it from the start. They did send that rider, but we
also sent one of our own to invite them to share our camp fire. I guess
the fact that Nekozar was not an official representative of yourself is
what caused the... petty squabble."

        Harek falls silent for a few moments before speaking again. "As to what
I counsel on the matter... I would say, of course, compensation for the
loss of wine of the master Dror... and maybe some grand gesture to
serve to sooth over relations and ensure that our trip here is well
spent rather than cut short and losses of trade and other things taken
on both sides." As he speaks, the Deacon runs a hand through his beard,
the other resting on his belt.

"Be well," says Alahasto low to the healeress, before he rises, stalking slowly
to Earen.

"Did you wish to start a war?" he whispers amiably. "Perhaps we will begin with
the burning roast and flaming wine."

He is too polite to interrupt the king with his back turned -- though both
hands loop around the belt which holds his sword.

        Earen looks down upon the Dwarven King, caring not that his back is
turned. Though she does turn part of her attentions to the Healeress--
and in her gaze, Earen is remorseful. Perhaps her inadvertant
yelling-at of Iherinwen has left her sour, but there is little she can
do about it right now.

        As Alahasto's words meet her ears, the elleth grins wide-- laughing
inwardly to match. "What would you have me do? Suffer Lord Celegorm's
ire instead and bandy about with the Dwarves, dancing around their
fires and drinking their wine til I too, topple over with drunkeness?"
Her whisper is toned softly, and it is sincere. "I do not mean to start
a war, but you know well whom we serve."

        Seeming all she will say for the moment, Earen listens to the one named
Harek. She does find a mild problem in his words, though it is the mere
interpretation of such-- rather than the words themselves. She will not
interrupt, nor will she turn her back; for those of the First-Born have
nuances better than most, even at the slandering of their Kings and
Lords.

Naugladur nods, considering Harek's words. He turns back to face the herald,
with the knight now at her side and smiles. The anger still can be discerned
from the creases around his deepset eyes, but there is a trace of genuine humor
in his tone as he speaks once more, "So, it would seem that an emissary of my
folk did seek out yours upon my people's arrival at this camp. My faith in
Master Dror was not ill-placed." The king shifts his gaze and inclines his
bearded head slightly to acknowledge the knight, including him now as he speaks
again, "My good deacon is wise as well as valiant and I can see worth," here a
chuckle, "A profit, as you would no doubt call it, in the path that he
advises." He turns now, to pace a bit toward the wagon load of wine, "This may
yet be salvageable, herald. I should think that a small feast is in order, to
smooth ruffled feathers. On both sides." He turns back to Earen again as he
concludes, "If you will see fit to pay for the spilled wine, I shall supply a
cask for the company, tomorrow, when you feed these dwarves who sought to share
their fine wares with those of your camp. Yes, and I'll attend myself, with
some few of my nobles, to toast your health and show that we dwarves know how
to forgive an insult."

        Earen is ready as Naugladur turns, her visage brimming with a faked
smile-- though it is well-worn, perhaps well-practiced also. Though the
words of the King do not reach her ears as fair as he would have them;
for she knows well the laced insults, being well-practiced in those
also. "King," she says, evenly, her head canted to the side a hair so
that she might regard Alahasto from the corner of her eye, as well as
give the King her attention-- or as much as she might care to spare.

        "I am glad you deem your folk faithful and worthy, that is not my
care-- though I have no disagreement with what Master Harek has spoken,
save one thing; I cared not who came forth from your camp, but the one
sent would offer the label of rude when he trods upon paths of rudeness
himself. There are protocols that will be practiced, and enforced, in
the lands where the Prince's ride and rest and hunt... and trade. Of
these he would hear not, neither would your folk, so who here has been
insulted, I wonder."

        Her question is rhetorical, the Herald continuing her words. "There
will be payment for nothing, for Master Dror, or what have you, spilled
his wine on the rider in his drunkeness. The rider, who in his folly
took drink, spilled it-- and he has been delt with, and will be delt
with further, for such insolence." Looking to where the aforementioned
Dror has collapsed, behind his wagon, Earen nods with a tilt of her
head. "Testiment to the spilling of his own hard-worked labours rests
there, snoring and drooling."

        Again, Earen's smile is rife, her visage crowned in annoyance still.
"Should your folk be willing to acknowledge their mistakes, my rider
will acknowledge his." She makes no mention of any mistakes of hers--
for she has made none-- even with heated words and actions.

From behind one of the dwarven wagons, a soft snoring can still be heard.

You sense: Harek gestures, "I never saw the rider take a drink from his cup; he
stood there like a tree. As to the 'protocols', this Herald never made any
reasonable attempt to put them into use. At least, from what I saw."

"A feast you asked of us already." Alahasto's smile is less practiced than
Earen's, moreover it is brittle at the edges. "We have given arm and leg to
make your food, and yet you come early: a guest waits for an invitation, does
he not?"

The knight tilts his chin briefly toward the wagon. "Celegorm will hear of
this; we will bring you his own answer."

The king listens in silence. When Earen has finished speaking he nods and
scratches his bearded chin. "Well, then herald. If Dror spilled his own wine
then that is that, and a different matter entirely."

"There remains the matter of your insolent words to me, then, and if you choose
not to accept the gracious and equitable solution put forth by my Deacon here,
that is your burden to bear. A cask of Dror's finest against the food to feed a
dozen of us would have been an even trade and saved face on both sides."
Naugladur turns back to Harek, briefly, "Rouse the sleepers, Deacon. These
'noble' elves lack the wisdom they take such pride in. Negabani, send word to
the camp, we will leave with the dawn. I do hope the High King's court is
better schooled in diplomacy."

With a seething snarl, the king turns back to Alahasto, "Offer your Prince my
sincere apologies, then good knight. For I will not dine in this company. Nor,
have aught else to do with it, barring bloodshed. Such of those of your folk
now trading in our camp will be sent back to you, unharmed. Beyond that, I
promise you nothing."

        The Deacon nods, giving a slight bow of the head to the King before
moving off to do as he is instructed and wake the sleepers.

Alahasto's face is one of shock; a warning glance shoots to the herald. "Earen,
forgive me," whispers the Knight, lips barely moving.

He spins toward the Dwarf, daring one step forward. "Good King. Must one
argument destroy all that our folk have strove for? I hear you have traveled
far, and indeed I was the one that first guided your party. Do you walk
hundreds of miles in vain? It is a waste."

His smile hovers on the edge of laughter, or perhaps sudden wrath; his voice is
like honey wandering near the fire. "Oft the mouth says in haste what the heart
does not wish to speak. Indeed, let the Prince Celegorm know of these matters.
But I plead that you stay to hear his answer."

        The elleth who can be blamed for letting a rider start this dispute,
stands quiet-- and idle. She has nothing more to say, and will not
harken to encourage the Dwarves to stay-- she has no love of them, nor
does she wish to tarry in these lands overlong to sate their complexes
of importance.

        Though she is terribly suprised at Alahasto, even as his forebearing
apology would reach her ears-- her mind is changed to him, now. Sour is
the look on her face, though it is not directed to the Dwarven King.

        Earen just stands, though, her eyes have found the hapless rider; and
she makes mental note to deal with him swiftly ere this business is
done-- whatever betide.

Soft boots approach. Upon hearing angered words, they pause. Then Ormesir steps
into view, a puzzled, and concerned look upon his face as he comes to the
group.

The dwarf king motions for his people to continue their preparations and pulls
Negabani aside for a quick, whispered conversation that seems to involve
frenzied hand gestures as much as words. Neither dwarf gives any indication
that they have heard Alahasto's hasty attempt at reconciliation. Before they
have finished their conference the wine wagon is being turned back down the
trail and the porters who had been bringing gifts to Celegorm's feast are
wending back toward the dwarven camp.

At length the king addresses the gold-clad knight, "My plan remains to leave
with the sunrise, good knight. If your prince has words for me before then, I
shall be happy to hear them." He nods to Alahasto and twists his lips at Earen,
almost as if he were preparing to spit, but all that emerges is a short burst
of harsh laughter.
At the laughter, Ormesir blinks and stares, baffled. Then he looks to his
fellow elves Askance, not yet daring to speak, lest he make the situation
worse.

        With the sleepers awoke, the Deacon glances to the King for a brief
moment before going back along the path himself towards the camp.

        Waving a hand in front of her face, lest she catch something from that
burst of laughter-- and it would not be a swift smile-- Earen's lips
are lighted well in a full-blown smile.

        "Farewell!" she chirps, laughter of her own loosed as she wonders on
Alahasto a time.

        Though, she does something peculiar then-- and strips from her torso,
the Prince's standard. She knows well what she has done, and what is
coming.

Shoulders droop, defeated; not another glance is lent to the leaving Dwarves.
But Alahasto now turns upon Earen.

"Explain to me what has happened," he hisses, ignoring Ormesir for the moment.
"And what you are doing now."

The dwarf king and his body guard are last of the dwarves to leave, striding
striding back toward their camp with purposeful steps.


In valleys woven with deceit
and washed with waters bitter-sweet
dark magic lurked in gulf and glen;
but out away beyond the ken
of mortal sight the eagle's eye
from dizzy towers that pierced the sky
might grey and gleaming see afar,
as sheen on water under star,
Beleriand, Beleriand,
the borders of the Elven-land.
