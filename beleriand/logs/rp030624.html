<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>08:44 PM<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Logfile from Beleriand-Malidhrin.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>A feast has begun, one of sight and sound if not yet of
taste. For in the great cavern sundered by the rushing Esgalduin, a ring of
ellith in splendid dress have gathered about the Queen of Doriath. In the midst
of the circle is a large wooden table, on its center a large smooth stone. On
either side are fine-weave baskets full of silky grain flour, pots of honey and
pitchers of cordial, the makings of the elven waybread whose shaping is
reserved for the Bereth and her ladies alone. Yet the implements before them
are not its most precious ingredient, rather the purity of spirit with which
they endow this ceremony both merry and solemn. A hauntingly beautiful sound
rises above the roar of the river far below and the sparkle of the fountain, a
song offered by the handmaidens to their mistress, and to Yavanna whose fruits
they celebrate, invoking the blessing of both of them over harvest past and
long journeys ahead.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Malidhrin holds the hands of those maidens standing next to
her, joining her voice with the others though more quietly than some. It has
not been many seasons that she has partaken of such a ceremony, and she shows
her excitement even as the splendor of the occasion brings serenity to her
eyes. These she has fastened upon the figure of the Bereth, of adoration and of
a keen desire to follow her promptings when it is time to do so.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Bereth's voice is clear, with unearthly loveliness as
she sings with her handmaidens in the way she taught them. Her eyes go to each
in turn, with maternal affection... her heart and mind perhaps removed to a
time when she served at the feet of Yavanna, looking at her mistress the way
her maidens are looking at her. The song is of the making of Arda, and
Yavanna's part in bringing forth fruits of the earth, of forest and field, a
song of harvest and creation and joy.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>And holding
one Malidhrin's hands is Tinaeriel, and she, too, joins her melody to the song,
her own eager anticipation for the work to come manifest in the lilt of her
voice as she sings alongside the other maidens. Eyes of blue lie upon the
Bereth, shifting to the maiden Malidhrin beside her for but a brief moment
afore they return to the Queen, wherein lie the same sort of adoration and
desire that might be found in the eyes of her fellow handmaid beside her.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Malidhrin's smile brightens as the light of Melian's eyes,
redolent of the Trees that are no more, rests with fondness upon her. As Melian
turns her gaze further onward, the young elleth's eyes turn up to her elder
Tinaeriel, gifting her with a shy if warm smile as well. She then glances back
as several handmaidens descend from the royal chambers, in their hands the
silver-leaf wrappings that will be used to cover the finished lembas. They add
their voices to the song as they break the circle briefly, resting the argent
coverings on the table with the other supplies.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>A smile
curves upon, at first just a little, and then spreads across the face of
Tinaeriel as the Bereth's eyes are upon her. But as the Queen's deep eyes move
farther about the maidens gathered, Tinaeriel again looks to Malidhrin, then
smiling upon her perhaps much as an elder sister might to one younger. The song
swells slightly with the addition of more maidens as they come, bearing the
silvern leaves, and Tinaeriel's voice still joins in the song of utmost beauty.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Still singing softly, Melian steps back, placing her hand on
one of the bowls. Reverently, but without undue pomp, she holds up the
ingredients, each in turn, a and offers them, for the nourishment and
well-being of the people of Doriath and the preservation of all that is good
and beautiful in the realm. When she has finished, the Bereth ceases singing,
and looks around the circle, singling out certain faces -- Malidhrin and
Tinaeriel among them -- who have been instructed aforetime to help put together
the ingredients of the queen's waybread.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>At the Bereth's prompting, Malidhrin steps forward, tugging
lightly at her companions if only to garner their moral support. Nervously she
picks up a crystal jar of honey, as does another handmaiden beside her, the
contents of the jars sparkling golden and almost translucent with pure
sweetness. She glances to Melian and then back to others of the Silivrieli,
awaiting them to spread flour on the stone.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>The eyes of
the Bereth upon her as a clear indication of her wishes, Tinaeriel steps
forward, her footfalls light as ever is her wont. Reaching near where Malidhrin
readies the honey, Tinaeriel herself takes up a basket of flour. Her eyes skim
across to Malidhrin, then to the Bereth, then down to the stone. There she
begins to pour the light and fine powder, a little of it rising from the stone
as faint plumes of flour-dust.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Others of the handmaidens come forward with their
ingredients, waiting for the fine cloud of flour to settle, and begin to pour
-- carefully, as they are supposed to know the measurements by sight. One or
two of them look up at the Bereth for approval, and she smiles back to them as
they finish their part of the task.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Malidhrin lifts the pitcher of honey as her companion does
the same, and a light stream of the golden liquid caresses the bed of flour.
Only a small amount, and then others step forward to pour cordial. In turn they
rest the pitchers back on the table. Another song begins as they await the
Bereth to put her hand to turning the flour over into the liquids, allowing her
a ceremonial first opportunity to touch what will be the life-nourishing
wafers.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Tinaeriel
steps back a bit after setting down the emptied flour-basket with little
flourish, her eyes shifting between the Bereth and the ingredients that will
soon be turned and mixed together. Joining the new song that begins then is her
lightly lilting voice, though now it is softer than before, and the elf-maid's
eyes then rest only upon the Bereth.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Melian steps forward, stretching out her pale, delicate,
strong and perfect hands, gathering the ingredients together before her, the
honey and cordial sweetening her hands, or the other way around... She turns
the mixture over on the flour, and mixes three times, then steps back, allowing
her maidens to help her -- there is a great deal of batter to be made into the
winter's store of lembas.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Malidhrin puts her hand to the turning of the dough as the
Bereth steps back, laughing lightly at both the feel of the dough on her hands
and the sight of her fellow handmaidens stepping forward to do the same. Puffs
of flour burst out onto lovely gowns, prompting more laughter, though the
ellith's movements on the stone are graceful and coordinated. Working together,
the simple elements begin to come together into a golden dough that more
resembles the wafers known and depended upon by Doriath's wardens, guard, hunters
and explorers.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Tinaeriel,
too, joins in the mixing, but there is no laughter from her lips as comes from
Malidhrin. But there are smiles, aye, bright smiles as the handmaidens together
turn the ingredients to dough by the work of their hands. Over and over
Tinaeriel mixes the portion of the dough before her, being careful to be sure
that all of the elements therein are properly blended.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Bereth herself chuckles quietly -- sacredness does not
always mean solemnity, and there is much joy that goes into this task. Melian
looks up at Malidhrin, and a laugh escapes her rosebud lips. She giggles --
yes, giggles -- at something on Malidhrin's face, but continues to finish the
mixing, which is nearly complete, and the batter smells sweet and inviting
already.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Queen's girlish laughter prompts more of the same in her
maids, though as their work carries on, chatter and laughter hushes as several
maidens enter the hall with trays of a porous stone. Among them are the
princesses of the realm, Galadriel and Luthien, the golden fair and she of the
twilight, leading this small procession. They exchange smiles with Melian and
then with the others. The honor of shaping the first lembas is granted the
Queen's daughter, and with a small word of blessing Luthien takes a mass of the
dough in her hands, spreading it out on the trays, its rich elastic character
allowing it to be spread quite thin. The other maidens look on, and in turn
step forward to fill more trays in the same manner, while others take the
prepared ones away to the kitchens to be baked. The thin wafers will not
require long in baking.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>And
following in the little procession of maidens who take the dough-laden trays to
the kitchens for the baking of the sweet wafers, there is Tinaeriel, who bears
one such tray. Smiles still abound throughout the work, for it is pleasurable,
and Tinaeriel disappears from the hall as she trails behind the others,
carefully balancing the tray in her hands.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As the last of the dough is being taken away, other trays of
finished lembas are being brought back to the hall by the ellith, their hands
wrapped against the heat. When the wafers cool, they will be broken along the
lines that were drawn through them before baking. With this new stage of the
waybread's making, other Doriathrim have begun to enter the hall, to receive a
small piece of the newly made lembas from the ladies' hands. In this way all
can share in the joy of the ceremony, even if by tradition not all could share
in its work.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Malidhrin has remained behind, her arms being yet too
delicate to carry the stone trays of bread. She seems fit to break out into a
dance, her steps light, and she turns pleased eyes upon the entry of the
finished lembas into the hall. She lends her hand to carefully breaking the
wafers into squares that will fit the silver leaves in which they are already
being wrapped by other maidens' hands.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>One such person is the towering Warden Hethelkalan. After
many, many long hours at the millstone, he feels that he should get a taste of
what was part of his labor. But, patiently he waits, softly playing a tune on
his panpipes, waiting for a better time, and so that he would not bother the
Queen any more that he needs to.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Malidhrin carries a silver tray with small pieces of lembas
about the hall, offering it to those who have gathered to sample the harvests'
goodness. She greets each with a bright smile, the warden Hethelkalan among the
others.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The queen and her daughter and Galadriel watch the last of
these proceedings from one side, as the handmaidens expertly perform the tasks
in which they have been instructed. As the door is opened to let others in the
city enter to taste the fruits of the royal ladies' labor, the queen graciously
murmurs words of welcome and blessing, before letting them sample what has been
set aside. She stays to watch and supervise and participate until the last
pieces have been wrapped, and put into baskets to be carried away to store or
to distribute to wardens at their cold posts above the underground city.</p>
