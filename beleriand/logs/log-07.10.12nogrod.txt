A short section of the path here seems to be wider than its extension on either side as the ground is more flat here, serving as a resting place for those climbing down or up the mountain along this trail. It does not appear as iff many have spent too much time here as you peer around and as the mountain air seems especially fierce here as compared to other parts of the mountains it may seem clear why this is so.

Kuzadeh

        His beard and his stature mark this one as a dwarf. He stands slightly more than four feet tall his beard is nearly half that by itself. Careful and intricate braids worked with beads lie across his barrel chest and belly, reaching well below his waist. Roughly half of the hair in his beard is confined in the braids, the remainder spreads out between them like wispy flames. He has reddish-brown hair atop his head, though the beard is rather a darker shade and much more red than brown. The skin of his face, at least what is visible of it above the beard, is rough and weathered. Green eyes with flecks of brown stare out of his ruddy countenance. His build is stocky, almost squat. Utterly lacking the lithe grace of the elves he somehow still manages to seem balanced and poised. His is the grace of the earth and his manner owes more to boulder and mountain than tree or star.
        His dress is primarily black. Black kilt made of fine suede hanging to his knee above black boots and with a black hooded cape over top of it all. In sharp contrast to the black is the brilliant blue of his tunic, contrasted at wrist and collar by clever embroidery in black and green. The tunic makes such a bold contrast to the unrelieved black of his other garments that it makes what might otherwise be somber garb seem almost cheerful. The clothes all appear to be well made and fit very well. 
        A wide leather belt, easily four inches across, cinches the kilt about his waist. A bone-handled dagger in a carved bone scabbard hangs from silver chains attached at either side of the belt buckle. The position of the chains holds the dagger at the center of the kilt's front panel.

Harek
        A Dwarf of average height, around four foot three, is this. Though not as exceptionally broad as some of his kin, he is not narrow either. The eyes, dark, glitter with life and intellect. Striking red hair does he have, with the beard hanging down to his chest. The beard itself is braided and bound with gold beads and and wire, arrayed in an intricate pattern around a main, central braid. The mustache (which joins the beard around the mouth) and the rest of the hair is unbraided and, at least as far as the hair from his head is concerned, falls to the shoulders.

        He is dressed in fine leather and wool. A light shirt covers the muscular torso, and light trousers cover the legs. Both of these are a light shade of brown, akin to the colour of wheat. Over this is a loose, red leather robe of many folds, decorated with gold runes and sigils, falling to the top of the boots in length and to the wrists in sleeves. It is belted around the waist by a gold belt, studded with sanguine rubies and lapis.

        A deep hood falls down the back from the hood, decorated with more gold runes and sigils. The feet of this Dwarf are covered with soft boots of black leather, with the bottom of the trousers tucked into them. They are laced by red, gold-tipped leather strips, with the remaining tied off around the leg. On the back is a mirrored shield with gold-inlaid sigils and runes upon it, while at the waist hangs a warhammer.

Negabani [Puppeted by Kuzadeh]

Short, stout and bearded, this is a dwarf. Standing some four feet tall and being rather broad of chest he makes an imposing figure despite of his lack of height. His red beard is split in the center all the way up to his chin and worked into two large braids that fall to his belt. Between the braids is tied a ribbon inscribed with runes that identify him as a lesser thane in service to the king of Nogrod, at least to those who can read such runes. His green eyes lend a touch of color to his weathered and ruddy features.
He is dressed for work in a comfortable woolen tunic of white, topped by a hooded cloak of bleached wool. In fact, all his clothing is white, ivory boots on his feet and a kilt of snowy wool about his waist. The clothes are well made, if rather unremarkable, and in good repair. The boots, however, do show some wear, as does the axe that hangs on his eggshell colored belt.

The moon hangs low in the Spring sky above the Blue Mountains. In the dwarven encampment there is a stirring of preparation and the remains of the evening meal, and such equipment as was used to prepare it, are packed away against an early departure come sunrise. Only a handful of dwarves are to be found without the camp and those, typically, are keeping a watch on the mountain trail.

The uzbad's herald emerges from the circle of tents and wagons and makes a frenzied gesture with his hands to draw the attention of some of those watchful dwarves. Coming upon two, who chanced to be passing close to one another the herald hisses in a breathless voice, "Good cousins! The uzbad sends me with an urgent message! Draw nigh."


Kuzadeh draws his cloak about him against the chill of the night air and turns to await the herald's pronouncement.
        At the frenzied gesture of the herald, and the hissed words, Harek frowns a moment before adjusting his walk to bring him towards the herald some. "And what is the urgent message of the Uzbad, cousin?" The Deacon arches an eyebrow slightly as he rests his hands upon his belt.

Negabani sketches a brief and hardly proper bow as both Deacon and Thane greet his advance, "The last of the scouts, he that was due back at sundown, has yet to return. The uzbad would have someone venture down the path to look for him." He glances down and shuffles one booted foot nervously, "The lad, well, he's my nephew and hardly old enough to be away from his mother's hearth." He gazes pleadingly at the pair of armed khazad.


Kuzadeh nods, as if the herald's plea had touched him, "Very well. Where was he last known to be?" He takes a handful of steps down the path while looking back to hear the herald's response.

        A deeper frown from the Deacon. "He has not returned? That is ill news indeed..." He nods as Kuzadeh speaks. "Ay, indeed. I shall go as well, and lend my help in the search." He does not move yet, looking to the herald for the answer.

Negabani bows again, this time much more deeply, "Down the trail he went, to look over the morning's road." Looking from one dwarf to the other he adds, "My service to you both for your help. Mahal guide your steps and bless you for your aid. I feel it is my place to go but I must attend the uzbad."

Kuzadeh begins to jog down the hill without further word to the herald. As he moves he grips the strap that holds the great axe that rests, slung across his back.

        A bow from Harek, with a slight smile. "I am sure the Maker shall." With that, he moves down the hill as well, steps swiftening as his axe is pulled from its place of rest on his back, following after Kuzadeh.

As the pair move some distance from the camp Kuzadeh glances at his companion. His voiced lent rhythm by the percussion of his footfalls, he says, "Well met, cousin. Though the circumstances are less than cheerful. I am Kuzadeh, Thane of Umahal of Narag."


        A slight, walking bow from the Deacon. "Well met indeed. Harek, weaponsmith and deacon, as well as Thane of Crodon of Baraz. And, ay, the circumstances are not ideal. Yet, if Mahal blesses this search, we shall find the young scout."


You make your way down the sloping path with relative ease. It seems as if this is one of the easiest paths to safely travel in the mountains.

Path descending from the Ered Luin
The main path here follows from the south on up the mountain. At this small crossraods you can see another path that descends into the wide plains of Thargelion, but you see little evidence of much travel along this path. The rocky terrain seems to have been cleared of debris in the path as you see few large rocks making it difficult to travel along these paths. There is little vegetation here, but looking further up the mountain it seems as if you can find none at all.

Gravelly Slope  

 Harek decides to climb down the face of the mountain towards the trails below.
Harek climbs down from the mountain trail and arrives after a short perios of time at the meeting of the trails here.

Harek has arrived.

Here, lower down the mountain's side, the moon is hidden from view behind the jagged peak of Mount Dolmed. But even what little light that remains is sufficient to illumine the trail. The pair have not fared far ere they hear cries for help form up ahead. As they round a corner in the trail a strange sight greets them: In a slender tree, just up the hill from the trail, a white clad dwarf clings precariously while beneath him a huge bear, the slenderness of his winter slumber failing to make him look less dangerous, attempts to push the tree over far enough to reach the hapless dwarf.

Kuzadeh takes stock of the situation quickly. He gestures to his companion, indicating that he should follow the path to come at the bear from behind. "We cannot risk going for help. The lad cannot hold on long. I will try to draw the beast off, if you can get the beardling down from his perch."

        The Deacon's steps quicken at cries of help: though, he stops, blinking some at the sight of not only the bear, but a Dwarf in a tree. The Deacon hefts his axe slightly, as if testing the weight before looking to Kuzadeh, nodding as the other speaks. "I shall do my best, certainly. With the beardling down, and sent back to camp, shall I help you take on the beast?"

Kuzadeh nods, his face grim, "I shouldn't fool myself by claiming we could outrun it."

        A solemn nod from Harek. "Mahal shall watch out for us, cousin." With that, he begins to carefully move down the path, eyeing both the bear and the scout to keep appraised of the situation.

You wield a Battle Axe.


Harek pulls Bundfelaku from the holder on his back, swinging it and testing the weight before settling it in his hands.
Kuzadeh slips his axe loose from the straps that hold it and watches the Deacon advance. Once the other dwarf is past the tree along the trail the armorsmith rushes forward with an inarticulate shout and waves his free arm to draw the beast's attention. 

For his part the bear shuffles away from the tree, startled by the sudden shout, and sniffs the air with a quivering muzzle.
        Carefully, Harek begins to move towards the tree, shifting his own axe to one hand. An eye is kept on the bear, while the other watches the beardling in the tree, free hand motioning slightly for the scout to remain still and silent.

the bear drops to his feet, stomping the ground with its in-turned paws. It twists its head to one side and unleashes a deafening roar. As soon as the last notes of its bellow fade it lunges several tentative steps toward Kuzadeh.

The Narag lord manages to stand his ground, relaxing slightly when he realizes that the charge was only a feint. With a furrowed brow he looks past the bear to judge his companion's progress.
        The Deacon wets his lips slightly, quietly breathing in and out slowly, trying not to attract the attention of the bear. The eyes flick towards the scout, and his free hand motions slightly for the dwarf to begin to slowly and carefully climb down.


The bear shuffles forward, snarling at Kuzadeh. Several yards still separate them, but the dwarf gives ground, stalling for time until the Zirak lad is safe.

        With the bear futher away, the Deacon quickens his pace until he is at the base of the tree itself. There, he pauses, watching the creature for several moments before he begins to motion with earnest for the scout to climb down from the tree; once the scout is down, instructions are quickly whispered by Harek.

        The young dwarf nods at the instructions, and begins to slowly move back towards the path, and from there back towards the encampment, trying not to make any noise that would attract the bear. Once the lad is on his way, the Deacon turns his attention towards the bear, hefting his axe as he begins to walk towards it.

Kuzadeh watches the stripling make his hurried way back toward the camp and shouts, at the bear, but for Harek's ears, "Well done! Now we need only kill the brute or fend him off until the lad can send help." He hefts his axe at the ready with a two handed grip as the bear rushes toward him again and anything else he might have said goes unspoken as he brings the weapon down in a fierce stroke, just as the bear's glistening teeth snap at his midsection.

You attack Huge Bear with your Battle Axe...he parries with his Bare Hands.
The bear weaves and sways in a manner that makes its movements difficult to guess.  With a roar of fury it rips at its enemy!

Huge Bear attacks you with his Bare Hands...you parry with your Battle Axe.
Kuzadeh steps back a few paces, reeling with the intensity of the bear's attack but still maintaining his footing.

        With a nod, the Deacon gives a hearty shout as he rushes the bear; the axe is swung in a short, powerful arc at the bear.


Harek attacks Huge Bear with his Battle Axe...Huge Bear solidly avoids his attack.
The attack brings an ireful retaliation from the massive bear.  Rushing forward, the beast snaps menacingly with its yellowed teeth.  Trying to sink them into its tormentor!

Huge Bear attacks Harek with his Bare Hands...solidly hitting and mildly wounding him!

        Harek brings his arms back -- but not quick enough to avoid the quick bite of the bear; though fast enough to avoid most of the damage. The Deacon grumbles, looking to his arm before glaring at the bear.

As the bear turns to attack Harek, Kuzadeh attempts to take advantage of its split attention. With a low, rumbled growl in his throat the dwarf hefts the axe again and brings it down in a sweeping stroke aimed at the beast's spine.

You attack Huge Bear with your Battle Axe...he parries with his Bare Hands.
The bear shuffles to one side with surprising speed, then swings one cruelly clawed paw at its adversary with murderous intent, attempting to decapitate its attacker!

Huge Bear attacks you with his Bare Hands...but you solidly avoid his attack.

Poor timing ruins Kuzadeh's attack, as the bear's movements against Harek allow it to shrug off what might otherwise have been a telling blow. The dwarf is able to step back in time to avoid the resulting ire from the beast and he casts a worried glance at Harek.


        The Deacon almost sneers at the bear, glancing to Kuzadeh for a moment. "Worry not, good cousin! Either it shall leave or we shall get help from the camp." With that, the axe is swung once more at the bear.


Harek attacks Huge Bear with his Battle Axe...barely hitting and mildly wounding him!

The attack brings an ireful retaliation from the massive bear.  Rushing forward, the beast snaps menacingly with its yellowed teeth.  Trying to sink them into its tormentor!

Huge Bear attacks Harek with his Bare Hands...Harek parries with his Battle Axe.


        This time, Harek is quicker. After the axe lands, it is pulled back and the haft is used to fend off another bite; a laugh comes from the Deacon.

Encouraged by the Deacon's success, Kuzadeh swings his axe low, aiming at the bear's legs this time. He grunts with the effort out into the attack.

The bear weaves and sways in a manner that makes its movements difficult to guess.  With a roar of fury it rips at its enemy!

Huge Bear attacks you with his Bare Hands...but you solidly avoid his attack.

The bear is quick on its feet, he seems unslowed by his recent long slumber. But though he avoids Kuzadeh's attack he is yet too slow to strike the dwarf in turn.
        Spurred on by his own success, the Deacon swings his axe once more at the bear as it turns to respond to Kuzadeh, a snarl on his face as he does so.


Harek attacks Huge Bear with his Battle Axe...Huge Bear barely avoids his attack.
The bear roars in rage and attempts to grapple its attacker with its massive paws, sweeping both clawed terrors at its foe!

Huge Bear attacks Harek with his Bare Hands...Harek solidly avoids his attack.


        Indeed, slowed not from slumber, the bear avoids the axe. But Harek steps back swiftly out of range of the paws of the beast, a scowl on his face. "No you do not..." The words are quietly muttered.


Kuzadeh sees an opening as the bear lunges toward Harek. With a sharp cry of "Azan!" he rushes forward and chops at the beasts neck.

You attack Huge Bear with your Battle Axe...solidly hitting and mildly wounding him!
Twisting its head to the left in some involuntary gesture of wrath the bear roars ferociously.  It dashes forward with surprising speed and attempts to lay open its foe!

Huge Bear attacks you with his Bare Hands...you parry with your Battle Axe.
The blow lands lower than intended, but it bites home nonetheless. A harsh laugh escapes Kuzadeh's lips as he dances back, well ahead of the bear's retaliatory attack.


        "A fine hit, cousin!" Shouts the Deacon as he moves forward swiftly as the bear is distracted, swinging once more at the bear, aiming to take or wound a leg.


Harek attacks Huge Bear with his Battle Axe...Huge Bear soundly avoids his attack.
The enormous bear swings its front paws in rapid succession.  Each blow aimed at the body of its attacker!

Huge Bear attacks Harek with his Bare Hands...barely hitting and mildly wounding him!

        A few scratches from the claws is the Deacon's reward as the bear moves away from the axe; for only the claws barely reach Harek, for he has moved backwards. And another step back is taken, a soft curse escaping him.

Kuzadeh snarls a curse under his breath and shouts, "Have a care cousin!" In spite of his own advice, the Narag thane presses his own attack, swinging at the beast's exposed flank.

You attack Huge Bear with your Battle Axe...he parries with his Bare Hands.
The bear shuffles to one side with surprising speed, then swings one cruelly clawed paw at its adversary with murderous intent, attempting to decapitate its attacker!

Huge Bear attacks you with his Bare Hands...but you solidly avoid his attack.
Kuzadeh loses his footing for a moment and is forced to reel back out of the bear's reach. This time his muttered curse is rather louder.

        A slight nod from Harek at Kuzadeh's words, and a brief grin. "Just some scratches. This one shall have to do better than that!" With a slight growl, the axe is swung mightily at the bear.


Harek attacks Huge Bear with his Battle Axe...Huge Bear parries with his Bare Hands.
The huge bear shrugs off the blow and rushes forward with a bellow of rage.  It raises one massive paw and swings it ferociously at its opponent!

Huge Bear attacks Harek with his Bare Hands...solidly hitting and moderately wounding him!

        The bear's return blow is quicker than the Deacon; it lands on the Dwarf's side and sends him staggering to the side and back. Another curse comes from the Deacon as he shakes his head slightly.


"Here now! No more of that!" Kuzadeh shouts to draw the bear's attention away from the reeling Deacon. Behind him, he hears the sounds of shouting dwarves, but he is too busy fending off the beast to answer the shouts. With a desperate gleam in his eye he thrusts the beak of his axe at the bear's shoulder.

You attack Huge Bear with your Battle Axe...barely hitting and mildly wounding him!
The huge animal seems suddenly hesitant.  It shuffles back a few steps and leaves itself open to another attack.

Huge Bear passes his turn to you.


The dwarf-lord's blade bites the bear's shoulder but glances off the bone beneath. Blood sprays as the bear shuffles back sniffing the air in the direction of the approaching dwarves. With a last bellowed roar, the animal turns and lurches into the brush, quickly to be lost from sight in the growing darkness.


        A laugh comes from Harek, leaning slightly on his axe. "A fine hit, cousin! A fine hit!" He glances briefly to his arm and his side before shrugging slightly to himself. "This has been a good night."


Kuzadeh nods, watching the beast's retreat. He too leans on his axe as dwarves from the camp run up behind the Deacon and himself. "Indeed it has cousin, well fought! But how are your wounds?"

        "Ay, indeed, you landed some fine blows." A few moments of silence from the Deacon before he speaks again. "Nothing entirely serious; some tending to them and rest and I should be fine. That last swipe was the most serious, but survivable."


Kuzadeh nods, "Well, my people can tend your wounds. I'll have them unpack a cask of ale as well. We'll raise a glass together, early morning or no!" Turning to the arriving throng he says, "You've come too late lads, all the excitement of the night is passed. But I thank you for coming as quickly as you did, even so." He cleans his axe on a rag drawn from his belt and returns it to its sling. Then, to Harek, he says, "Come cousin, a leisurely stroll back up the hill. I say we've earned it."

        Harek grins, nodding his head. "Ay. Ale and bound wounds is always good!" Axe slung onto his back, the Deacon begins to move up the hill, back towards the camp.


In valleys woven with deceit
and washed with waters bitter-sweet
dark magic lurked in gulf and glen;
but out away beyond the ken
of mortal sight the eagle's eye
from dizzy towers that pierced the sky
might grey and gleaming see afar,
as sheen on water under star,
Beleriand, Beleriand,
the borders of the Elven-land.
