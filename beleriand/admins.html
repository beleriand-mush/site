taking in ideas for new features, as well as making sure everything is running
properly. Things like maintaining code, purging old and unused messages, as
well as overseeing the players' mailboxes, are tasks pertinent to this job.

and mailing groups can be directed to this admin. Normally this last is
restricted to culture wardens, unless it is of general MUSH interest.

this GA works with the CAs of all involved cultures to ensure the plot 
runs smoothly and effectively and is OOCly satisfying to all as much as

<A NAME="LocalCodeZMO"></A>
<P>
<H3>Local Code &amp; ZMO</H3>
Contact: <B>Ulmo</B>

commands. Cultures which lack admins in the area of coding are encouraged 
to contact this, or any other coder admin they feel comfortable with, for 
help.
<A NAME="ManagingWizard"></A>
<P>
<H3>Managing Wizard</H3>
Contact: <B>Ulmo</B>
<P>
The Managing Wizard acts on behalf of the GA team to oversee the 
administration of the MUSH. This includes appointing CWs and overlooking the 
culture administrations in general, and also maintaining this list of GA jobs, 
assigning tasks as needed, bringing items forward for a vote and seeing them 
through, and basically make sure that all issues have been taken care of. The 
Managing Wizard is appointed by the collective body of Wizards and ultimately 
serves as a clearing house of responsibilities and daily operations activity 
of the MUSH as a whole.
<A NAME="NewbieTrailCharacterGeneration"></A>
<P>
<H3>Newbie Trail &amp; Character Generation</H3>
Contact: <B>Telperion</B>
<P>
It is the responsibility of this GA to ensure that new players have a smooth
introduction to the game. It is important that the process be as easy and
intuitive as possible, while really drawing them in and grabbing their
interests.

<H3>Reserved Characters</H3>
Contact: <B>Mandos</B>
<P>
This GA receives and handles nominations for Reserved Characters, which 
includes roles named by Tolkien (Features) and characters belonging to 
Reserved Races (as Great Eagles, Balrogs, etc.). He is responsible for 
maintaining the list of locked names, as well as monitoring current RCs to 
ensure a reasonable level of activity and adherence to theme. Finally, it 
is his responsibility to ensure development and implementation of RC 
policy.
<A NAME="StatsTrainingLanguages"></A>
<P>
<H3>Stats, Training &amp; Languages</H3>
Contact: <B>Mandos</B>
<P>
This admin has the duty of overseeing players' combat stats, training levels, healing skills, and language skills. Primarily, this consists of setting Features' starting STLs, and otherwise making sure that the game is going forward in a fair and thematic manner.
<P>
If a player has a complaint about any of their STLs, they should bring the matter to the attention of their CW first, rather than going directly to the STL admin. The STL admin may make a judgment in the case of an emergency, but in most cases he will want to confer with the CW anyway.
<P>
Due to overlap of responsibilities, this job is usually held by the same admin who is the Archarb and who is also in charge of Restricted Characters.
<A NAME="TrainersTeachersHealers"></A>
<P>
<H3>Trainers, Teachers &amp; Healers</H3>
Contact: <B>Mandos</B>
<P>
Culture wardens should contact this admin in order to add or remove 
trainers, language teachers or healers in their cultures. At the same 
time, wardens should let the admin know which levels should these skills 
be set to: for trainers, a list of primary and secondary weapons of their 
choice; similar for teachers, a list of languages and to what level they 
should be set; and finally for healers, the level of the healing skill.
