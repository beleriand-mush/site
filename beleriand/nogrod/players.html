<TD><FONT SIZE="-1">Dr&oacute;r is an old Dwarf, short and shifty but with an air of some assumed
nobility and, certainly, some pride. A grey beard forks from his chin onto his
chest, but no lower, for this is no Longbeard, but a Firebeard of Nogrod. He
has sharp black eyes and bushy grey eyebrows set in his weatherbeaten face.
His hands, too, are calloused and worn.

Dr&oacute;r wears a black tunic, decorated with a great silver seal: the coat of arms
of the King of the Hollowbold, which this vassal displays proudly. But over
all of this he wears an old grey cloak which covers his arms and back but
parts in the front like an overcoat, and the grey hood attached is thrown over
his head. You can see baggy woolen black pants upon his legs, and black boots
upon his feet.

<TD><FONT SIZE="-1">The figure before you stands no more than a few inches over four feet tall, yet somehow appears a bit physically imposing. Khala's long straight brown hair, which hangs loose and free, has a touch of red in it, accentuating her tanned, well-muscled features. Her beard is soft and intricately woven with small colorful beads. Her complexion is rosey, her eyes crystal blue and sparkling and her mouth is perfectly shaped. She has a warm and bubbly personality. She wears practical garb, if a bit unremarkable..a reddish colored woolen tunic and leather leggings. On her feet are soft leather knee-high boots.

<TD><FONT SIZE="-1">Your eyes fall onto a Khazad, with fiery bright red hair and platted beard 
encrusted with gems, which falls lightly to his chest. His eyes are bright 
blue, and are topped with eyebrows of a slightly darker hue of red. His 
hands hang lightly at his side, and seem strangely lost as they are kept 
still. 
<P>
He is dressed in a dark tunic and breaches which are tucked into black boots. 
Upon his left breast is the red emblem of the Baraz faction, and about his 
kneck there hangs a small gold chain, and attached to his belt is a knife 
of high quality.</FONT></TD>

<TD><FONT SIZE="-1">Gamlin, to some, would appear to be your 'stereotypical' Khazad. Four feet and 
a few inches and stout with a slight plumping he stands stocky and sturdy. 
A long black beard, clumps of which have been neatly braided and tied off 
with a black cord, which reaches down to his belt and the black hair, also 
braided in places, that falls down over his shoulders and ends at his 
shoulder blades. His eyes are of a bluish grey and sit deeply in his skull 
beneath two black bushy eyebrows and flanking a plump nose. Adorned in a 
simple black tunic and dark brown breaches, that are held up by a large 
shiny buckled leather belt and is tucked into his big scuffed boots.

<TD><FONT SIZE="-1">His beard and his stature mark this one as a dwarf. He stands slightly 
more than four feet tall his beard is nearly half that by itself. Careful 
and intricate braids worked with beads that appear to be made of diamonds, 
with a handful of rubies and onyxes as well, lie across his barrel chest 
and belly, reaching well below his waist. Roughly half of the hair in his 
beard is confined in the braids, the remainder spreads out between them 
like wispy flames. He has flame-red hair atop his head, though the beard 
is rather a darker shade. The skin of his face, at least what is visible 
of it above the beard, is rough and weathered. Green eyes with flecks of 
brown stare out of his ruddy countenance. His nose is rather hawkish and 
his brow seems to be beset by a permanent scowl. His build is stocky, 
almost squat but shows clear evidence of great strength. Utterly lacking 
the lithe grace of the elves he somehow still manages to seem balanced and 
poised. His is the grace of the earth and his manner owes more to boulder 
and mountain than tree or star.
<P>His dress is that of a dwarf-lord of the highest rank. Fine leather 
boots on his feet, a kilt of white leather about his waist and on his 
torso, a most exquisite hauberk of double-linked mail. The mail coat is 
set with jewels in the alternating rows of its rings. Dozens of tiny 
diamonds shimmer in stripes across his shoulders and down the sleeves to 
his elbows. The chest and skirts of the knee length byrnie boast 
alternating stripes set with rubies and black onyxes. A longsword hangs in 
a jeweled scabbard at his side and a full helm, the visor worked in the 
likeness of some horrifying beast, glitters in gilded splendor where it 
hangs tied at his belt.</FONT></TD>
