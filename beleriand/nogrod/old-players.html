<TD>Something is disturbing about this dwarven figure, though you can not tell what exactly it his. He looks around with keen eyes, but not does not appear to have a piercing glare of understanding. Perhaps it is the extremeness of the stereotypical dwarf that is before you that is unsettling. He does not appear to be stronger than the average dwarf, nor to be more weather-worn. His steps are sure, but not bold.</TD>

<TD>&Ucirc;mahal is an old Dwarf, short and shifty but with an air of some assumed nobility and, certainly, some pride. A grey beard forks from his chin onto his chest, but no lower, for this is no Longbeard, but a Firebeard of Nogrod. He has sharp black eyes and bushy grey eyebrows set in his weatherbeaten face. His hands, too, are calloused and worn.<P>&Ucirc;mahal wears a black tunic, decorated with a great silver seal: the coat of arms of the King of the Hollowbold, which this vassal displays proudly. But over all of this he wears an old grey cloak which covers his arms and back but parts in the front like an overcoat, and the grey hood attached is thrown over his head. You can see baggy woolen black pants upon his legs, and black boots upon his feet.</TD>

<TD VALIGN="top" WIDTH="90">History:</TD>
<TD>&Ucirc;mahal was born in Nogrod, the son of Lord Narag. At this time House Narag had fallen low. Time was when the lord of Narag would be vassal to the King, and Lord Chancellor. No longer. Now &Ucirc;mahal's father was vassal to a vassal of Lord Azan, who had risen to fill the positions long ago held by House Narag. Practically the only asset left to House Narag was now the Dolmed's Horn Inn, which, while undoubtedly the best Inn in the Hollowbold, by itself was nothing when compared to the power and riches controlled by Lords Azan and Baraz. As a young (by Dwarven standards) lad, &Ucirc;mahal inherited his father's innkeeping business. He was never satisfied with his lot, being not rich enough he said, and too low a vassal in the society of Nogrod. So he set out into the world on merchantile missions, leaving his business in the hands of his serfs and trying to sell all sorts of cheap goods in the faraway markets of Nargothrond, Himring, and especially Doriath. Among other folk he always went by the name of Dr&oacute;r. For many years he spent much of his life divided between the Hollowbold and the Thousand Caverns. As he aged and grew more crafty, he started getting into the wine trade, a profitable one that, selling the fine wine of the faraway southern land of Dor-Winion to the eager markets of Elves in the north. Though at first he had been a bit of a swindler, so what? Now he was an established, respectable merchant, climbing his way up through the ranks of Nogrod's capitalistic feudalism, and now he is himself a vassal of Dinazan, Lord Azan himself. Now Dinazan and he were cousins of some sort. Seems somewhere along the line there Dinazan's ancestor had been the upright, successful older brother, and &Ucirc;mahal's ancestor had been the black sheep of the family. And though Dinazan respected his cousin's success, he still perhaps felt towards him as an older brother feels for a younger: a little scornfully. &Ucirc;mahal had never been the upright aristocrat and statesman that Dinazan had been.Still, what with one thing or the next, &Ucirc;mahal somehow managed to climb near the top. And with Dinazan's disappearance and assumed death or capture in battle with Angband near Himring, &Ucirc;mahal was the most obvious choice for leading the Black faction and stepping in as Lord Chancellor to the King of Nogrod. Less pompus than old Dinazan he is, though less capable some argue. But the Dwarves call him Lord, and that's how things be until Dinazan returns. And does that look like it'll happen? Hasn't yet. Been maybe five years now. So &Ucirc;mahal does as he likes, and he's getting on in years, a respectable old Dwarf he is.</TD>

<TD>Deep lines crest this dwarf's brow lending a look of perpetual dissatisfaction to his already serious demeanor. His dark brown eyes oft narrow into mere slits and peer out from his leathery features. The scalp is mostly bare, but the thick tufts still about his ears and his proud reddish-brown beard reveals his kinsmen's line. For it being something of a family trait, the hair is speckled with grey, its length kept well trimmed though it appears rather ragged and unkempt. Garbed in a thick cotten tunic, his stout forearms remain bare and laced with dozens of small scars earned from a life spent mostly underground. Over this a faded leather vest completes his torso raiment from which depend several small chisels each well fitted to the sides of the garment. He wears the loose fitted leggings and thick soled boots akin to those of any other artificer within Tumanzahar. He bears no ornaments other than a gold band about the small finger of his left hand, this denoting him as a high ranking guildsman.</TD>

<TD>The deeply red hair of this stately elder Dwarf frames his face in the color of smouldering coals. The face itself is as if it were carved from the solid rock of the earth, stern, immovable features and eyes as cold and dark as agate. His complexion is a ruddy, claylike color, hard worn by time, appearing as tough as boiled leather. The beard that sprouts from his chin, conceals much of the lower half of his face, but is in length, only to the upper reaches of his sturdy chest. Through the dark red of this fiery beard, are streaks of silver hue, clear and bright, they gleam against the dark background.<P>Sturdy mail of steel chains covers the Dwarf from shoulder to boots. Placed over the heavy tunic is a steel breastplate, bearing a device in silver, of a silver hammer beating upon an anvil in the foreground, a crossed sword and axe behind. Thick, powerful chest and limbs move beneath the mail, down to the thick leather gloves on his hands, and tough, iron-shod boots on his feet.<P>Fastened to his belt is a short, wide scabbard, bearing a sword. The scabbard itself is crafted of silver, as is the hilt of the weapon. Upon his other hip, fastened to the belt is a large, menacing axe. The back of the axe-head is shaped into a long, wicked spike, as is the pike atop it. The blade itself is fashioned to hook down and inwards. Intricate metalwork adorns the center of the axe-head, where it attaches to the haft.</TD>

<TD>First impression: Brown lively eyes, trying to catch yer own, peppy yet with a stern look, an eyebrow slightly raised as in thought... A gleaming silver chain mail can be discerned below a bright blue cloak, and he wears a knapsack at his back. A big, bulky nose adorns the center of the face, yet his ears seems small. Behind his left ear is some sort of wood stick, easily detected as the wooden handle on a Dwarven Axe. A large brown beard covers the rest of his facial features, and grows together with his brown hair. He wears a pair of brown trousers, made by leather hide, and on his belt is an emblem, carrying the symbol of a shovel and a pick. His boots are also made by leather, yet they look strangely small for the stocky built character.</TD>

Tharg's dark brown eyes almost blend in with his pupils, giving him a rather surly look. A thick, flowing beard grows from his chin and laps at his chest. He wears a rather impressive tunic and robe, both of fine yet sturdy fabric, and both predominantly black in color with silver and gold accents.</TD>

<TD>Standing just under 4 feet, Kaylys is perhaps a bit shorter than most female dwarves. Her long, dark brown hair is pulled back from her round face, loosely braided, hanging to her mid-back, where it is tied with a silver ribbon. Her eyes are dark brown as well, large and lipid, with a look of knowledge to them. Her nose is short and turned up, her lips perhaps a bit thin, her dark brown beard kept short and neatly trimmed.<P>She wears a tunic of deep blue woven cotton. The neckline scoops a bit, revealing a thin silver chain around her neck, from which dangles a single pearl. The sleeves are long, but usually pushed up to her forearms, the tunic ending just below her hips. Beneath the tunic, she wears trousers of dark blue wool, her feet clad in dark brown boots. Overtop of all, she wears a cloak of dark brown, with a large hood capable of completely covering her head. The cloak is belted at her stocky waist by a thick belt of leather, from which hang several small pouches.</TD>

<TD>The figure of a male khazad can be seen not to far away. He looks to be a middle-aged khazad, or a little younger than two hundred years of age. His beard though does not match how old his face looks, as it only falls less than a foot from his chin. And along with his short beard, the khazad himself is very short, standing not even three feet tall.<P>The khazad is wearing a grey cloak which was obviously made for someone taller than he as it drags on the ground as he moves. Under his cloak he is wearing a brown leather vest which covers a cloth shirt under that even.<P>The khazad's clothes are a little bit dirty, and are tinged with the color of rust that points to the fact that he was just repairing some metal of some sort which also means he's some sort of a smith.</TD>

His beard is pulled together into a tie just above the top of his chest. Despite his size Rhadak's movements contain an aire of nobility and his hair, though unkempt and wild shines bright red. His green eyes are set deeply in his head, a prominent brow jutting out above them is dominated by bushy red eye brows.<P>Rhadak is wearing a long red-dyed woolen tunic. Resting on his large shoulders the jacket is open and flows down and around his massive figure, ending at his ankles. A simple black shirt covers his torso. His brick colored pants are held up by a fine leather belt with and intricate silver buckle. Etched into the buckle is a picture of a crossed hammer and chisel. Tough black leather boots poke out from underneath his pants.</TD>

<TD>Your eyes fall upon a khazad with dark red hair and beard. He is well trimmed, his beard falling lightly onto his chest. Bushy eyebrows of the same color shade eyes of gleaming brown. It is in these eyes that a glow seems to emit; a glow of power and fierceness; nobility and calm calculated thoughts. Standing at his full height he seems to have an air of nobility. His face and body seems to be etched straight from the stone of the land. Each and every feature well defined and sturdy. He is clad in a tunic of silver, with black coat over it. The coat is lined in red embroidery and upon his left breast a round silver seal; his coat of arms. Brown breeches are tucked into thick black boots. A chain of fine silver is hung about his neck but drops into the top of his tunic, hiding whatever emblem or medallion that hangs from it's length.</TD>

<TD>One word would be enough to describe this little critter - short, even for a khazad. However, it seems what was taken from him in height has been added in width. The large tummy, together with the chubby cheeks and fat lips is all it takes to make this dwarf get mistaken with a walking barrel. The leather cap and short reddish beard make some attempt to bring a general idea of khazadness to the little being, yet with limited success. Apparently the leather trousers are also doomed to failure. It is only thanks to the large dark eyes and the small reddish nose that in a way identify this fellow as a member of the dwarven race.<P>As for the remaining picture - a pair of leather boots, a touch woolen shirt and a ragged leather vest are all there is. Oh, and naturally a leather belt which is like the metal ring of a barrel... which is slightly tight.</TD>

<TD>Being born in a family of smiths it is was only naturally for Dzhudzhe to reach for the hammer as well. Yet soon enough it was clear that he was shaped for other deeds, or at least he wanted to shape himself for other deeds. Being the nineth child in the family ensured that his parents didn't keep an eye too much on him. Naturally they were sure he did his due in work, yet no particular hopes were placed on Dzhudzhe.<P>Time past and when Dzhudzhe became a young dwarf he had a goal in life - to become of the Silver clan. Naturally, that was but a distant dream and even becoming a serf and squire of a dwarf of the Royal Army the dream is far from fulfilled.<P>Having made this choice it was also necessary for the young dwarf to chose an occupation capable of providing him enough money to live, no longer having to rely on his parents'. Having certain knowledge of working as a smithy the khazad became an apprentice in that area hoping it would be enough to keep if not his pocket full then at least his stomach. Alas, that business didn't seem to resourceful and but after a while the young dwarf found it necessary to change his occupation. With his strength and knowledge of metals mining was an obvious choice, where he seemed to have rather more luck. Fate too seemed to smile on him, for in but half a decade he was noticed by lord Barzyn and made his serf which Dzhudzhe remains to this day.</TD>

The former is long, but pulled back in a braid that hangs onto his back, while the latter hangs past his thick leather belt and is neatly braided into two strands each tied with a leather thong with beads of gold. Through his bush main you can see his ruddy stone-like visage. Though young in appearance (if you happen to be familiar with dwarves) his skin shows the weathered signs of many years. He is clad in a heavy woolen shirt. Its shade of gray is stained with darker marks of dirt and soot. The shirt is held fastly shut by a thick black belt with a large golden buckle and hangs well past his waist. His breeches and boots are of black leather.</TD>

<TD>Damur was born to as normal a family as one could expect for a Dwarf. His father, Damun DragonHammer, was a weaponsmith of some stature in Nogrod society. Damun's wife, Alanu, was a great weaver of her time as well.<P>Soon after Damur was brought into the world it was prophesized that he would create a great weapon. More specifically that he would craft a hammer of great power. It was also said that the hammer would honor his family name. Thereby bring the 'DragonHammer' prophesy to light.<P>The prophesy had been kept secret from Damur until the fateful day that his parents were slain by yrch on their way to Hithlum. It was said that the number of yrch was so overwhelming that the battle only lasted a few minutes, and that all in the party were slain. Whence the news reached Damur he was immediately told of the prophesy that had been kept from here for his younger years, and he immediately went to thinking of the design of the magnificent weapon.<P>Since that fateful day Damur will get a vision, every so often, showing the 'DragonHammer' to his mind's eye. With each vision the detail gets more descriptive, and the design more laid out in the mind of Damur. Knowing now that this quest was prophesized for him to complete he frantically tries to get every detail on paper before it may disappear from his memory forever. The dream of the hammer is swirling in the mists that is confusion. The hammer is out calling to him now, begging that it be brought into being. The Dragonhammer....</TD>

Around the waist of this stout dwarf is a thick wide belt with a silver buckle that is always polished to be as shiny as possible. Black pants cling snugly to his stubby but strong legs, and then continue down to his also black boots. The break between pants and boots can hardly be seen in the sun and cannot be seen in the shadows. The only visible weapon is a staff which he uses to help correct the limp he has on his left side.</TD>

<TD>Dagnor was born unto his parents, Drana and Kadim, not so many years ago. As a child, he spent most of his time watching his father work. He especially liked to play with the beautiful, sparkling stones that Kadim used to create his jewelry. It was this intense intrest in his father's work that led him to his current apprenticeship. Little else is known about Dagnor's parents other than that, like Dagnor himself, they were also serfs of Tharg and worked very hard to provide for Dagnor's well-being.</TD>

<TD>Faraim, son of Thrain the Hammerfist, stands nearly five feet tall with a build that remains stocky despite his above-average height. His skin deeply tanned from years at work in the forges of Nogrod his arms have thickened with the labours of his works, and his meaty fists resemble a mace from their girth. Faraim's beard, a source of dwarven pride, has been carefully cultivated and divided into two halves. Each half of his deep crimson beard has been braided and draped over his shoulders so as to not interfere with his craft. HIs garb is practical if bland consisting mostly of various shades of grey. There is one color of note that stands out, red. He wears a simple red armband on his left arm, whether shirtless or wearing his grey jerkin. The only moments he is caught without it is when he is at the forge where he wears only a leathern apron over his tanned skin.</TD>

<TD>Short and stocky stands this dwarf, not too unlike the rest of his kind.
Standing a wee bit above four feet in hight, he is not the shortest of the
Khazad but still is not large. His eyes are black pools set into his face. His
hair seems to compliment his eyes, as if it were designed to do so. It is of a
deep black, as is his beard. The hair atop his head falls to about the middle
of his neck, unlike his beard, which makes its way down to the bottom of his
chest or the top of his stomach.</TD>
