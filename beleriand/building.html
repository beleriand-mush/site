In order to improve the quality and consistency of the MUSH, we have some building guidelines which we insist that everyone adhere to. Construction may be inspected by the admins, and you may be required to rebuild (or even destroy) work if it does not meet approval. You should always have admin approval before creating any new rooms or exits.

<P>
<A NAME="Descriptions"></A><DIV CLASS="hr"><HR /></DIV>
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/descriptions.gif" WIDTH="186" HEIGHT="30" ALT="DESCRIPTIONS">
<P>
It's hard to say what constitutes a perfect description, but here are some general guidelines and rules which you should try to adhere to:
<UL>
<LI>Most importantly, your descriptions should describe what a player *sees*. It should not convey information that the character cannot determine by looking around - neither the player nor the character is psychic.
<P>
It also should not try to think for the player, or dictate what the player would feel in that spot.  Provide the cues - but let the player decide how to act on them. Remember that the way a character might react to something may depend a lot on their species or culture! An orc's idea of art may be an elf's idea of grisly horror.<P></LI>

<LI>Avoid words which convey little information, particularly generic adjectives like &quot;beautiful&quot;, &quot;ugly&quot; and so forth.  Instead, provide vibrant details which help the player to feel like he is really there.  &quot;<TT>You are in a beautiful garden</TT>&quot; is not as good as a description which mentions the bright red roses, the little fragrant purple blossoms on the vines going up the walls, and the white marble fountain in the center.<P></LI>

<LI>Use good English. Avoid colloquialisms. Check your spelling.  Bad language and misspelling become irritants if you have to see them every time you pass through a room.  More significantly, many of our players are not native English speakers, and can be severely confused by grammatical errors or just overly colloquial phrasing.
<P>
Have players who are known for good descriptions proof your work and offer advice.  It's very hard for anyone to judge their own writing.<P></LI>

<LI>As a general rule, avoid putting the descriptions of NPCs into the descriptions of rooms and exits.  If you are describing a busy location such as a marketplace, you might mention the general hubbub and that many folk are present, but you should not go so far as to describe individuals present.  You may wish to create a puppet to put in the room if you want to have an NPC which stands out from the crowd.<P></LI>

<LI>Don't use the ANSI color codes in your descriptions.  You can use the 'hilite' attribute if you want, but use it sparingly. If you do use highlighted text (boldface), put the highlighted phrase in quotation marks as well, for the benefit of those people who are not set ANSI.
<P>
The reason for avoiding color is that even if the player's terminal supports ANSI and COLOR, you don't know what the actual colors are. (Just because the MUSH calls a color &quot;red&quot; for example doesn't really mean it's going to be red on everyone's screen: the ANSI control code really means something akin to &quot;select color 3&quot;, and there is no absolute mapping of color numbers to colors).  Also, depending on what a player uses as their background color, you could end up with text displayed in the same foreground and background colors (effectively just looking like colored blocks on the screen).<P></LI>

<LI>Don't use tabs &quot;<TT>%t</TT>&quot; for formatting - people can have different tabstop settings and what works on one terminal won't look right on another.<P></LI>

<LI>Use blank lines to separate paragraphs in long descriptions.  Don't indent paragraphs though.  This is really just a stylistic convention we have adopted for this MUSH; other ways are equally valid but we ask you do it this way on this MUSH.<P></LI>

<LI>Don't make any assumptions about the width of the player's terminal - in particular, don't try to line things up in columns by inserting spaces and depending on where the line wraps.  If you are doing something which really needs to have tabular data (that is, text aligned in columns), then force line breaks by including &quot;<TT>%r</TT>&quot; in the text, and limit the width of individual lines to 78 characters (79 in a pinch, but never use 80 because some terminals will automatically wrap when you print in column 80 whereas others only wrap when you try to print the 81st character. This results in things which look right on some terminals coming out double-spaced on others.)</LI>

<P>
<A NAME="Exits"></A><DIV CLASS="hr"><HR /></DIV>
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/exits.gif" WIDTH="85" HEIGHT="30" ALT="EXITS">
<P>
There are four basic attributes which any properly done exit will have:
<UL>
<LI>All exits MUST have an <TT>@OSUCCESS</TT> and <TT>@ODROP</TT>.
<P>
The <TT>@OSUCCESS</TT> and <TT>@ODROP</TT> messages should enable people in the room to follow behind you easily, or know where you arrived from.<P></LI>

<LI>All exits SHOULD have an <TT>@SUCCESS</TT> and <TT>@DESCRIBE</TT> as well.  If an exit is set <TT>TRANSPARENT</TT>, then it must have an <TT>@DESCRIBE</TT>.  It is very confusing to see &quot;<TT>You see nothing special.</TT>&quot; followed by the description of a room.
<P>
For outdoor locations, the <TT>@SUCCESS</TT> message should provide a hint to the player about how far or long they have travelled, to aid them in working out their IC travel time.<P></LI>

<LI>Do NOT put an <TT>@ODESCRIBE</TT> on an exit.  This just generates useless noise which everyone has to see whenever a player looks at an exit.</LI>
</UL>
<P><BR>
<IMG SRC="images/exitnames.gif" WIDTH="306" HEIGHT="29" ALT="EXIT NAMING AND ALIASES">
<P>
This is a controversial area, and opinions differ widely.  Nonetheless, we have adopted a particular style and expect everyone to adhere to it.  We do not do this because one style is inherently better than another, but simply to maintain a certain level of consistency across the MUSH.  Our guidelines and requirements for exit naming are:
<UL>
<LI>Exits should have a &quot;full&quot; name and normally should also have one or more aliases.  The &quot;full&quot; name is what the player sees when he looks around the room.  It should be complete words.  The exit may have any number of &quot;aliases&quot; as well, these are additional names for the exit which are separated from each other by semicolons &quot;<TT>;</TT>&quot;.  As an example:
<P>
<TT>&nbsp; &nbsp; @name &lt;exit&gt; = Oak Door;Out</TT><P></LI>

<LI>Case is not significant to the MUSH parser (you can use upper- or lowercase to go through an exit), but we do use capitalization to provide hints about alias names.  If you take all the capital letters from the full name of the exit, this should be one of its aliases.  Hence, for the above example we should actually have:
<P>
<TT>&nbsp; &nbsp; @name &lt;exit&gt; = Oak Door;OD;Out</TT><P></LI>

<LI>Exit aliases should include any &quot;obvious&quot; short forms for the full name. If an exit name is multiple words, then usually the first word alone should be a valid alias.  To continue with our example name, &quot;<TT>Oak</TT>&quot; and &quot;<TT>Door</TT>&quot; are probably good aliases:
<P>
<TT>&nbsp; &nbsp; @name &lt;exit&gt; = Oak Door;Oak;Door;OD;Out</TT><P></LI>

<LI>Compass directions should always include the obvious abbreviations:
<P>
<TT>&nbsp; &nbsp; Northeast;NE &nbsp;North;N &nbsp;Northwest;NW &nbsp;West;W</TT><BR>
<TT>&nbsp; &nbsp; Southwest;SW &nbsp;South;S &nbsp;Southeast;SE &nbsp;East;E</TT><BR>
<TT>&nbsp; &nbsp; Up;U &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Down;D</TT>
<P>
You do not need to capitalize the second part of compound compass directions in the full name of an exit.  In other words, just use &quot;<TT>Northeast</TT>&quot; and not &quot;<TT>NorthEast</TT>&quot;.<P></LI>

<LI>If there is an obvious main exit from a room, or only one exit for for a room, then it should include the aliases &quot;<TT>Out;O</TT>&quot;.<P></LI>

<LI>Avoid exit names which match MUSH commands, or common abbreviations for MUSH commands.  In particular, avoid the following abbreviations for exits:
<P>
<TT>&nbsp; &nbsp; P,PA &nbsp;B,BR &nbsp;L,LO, I,IN</TT>
<P>
The reason for this is that these are also abbreviations for commonly used MUSH commands (<TT>PAGE</TT>, <TT>BRIEF</TT>, <TT>LOOK</TT>, <TT>INVENTORY</TT>) and the MUSH command interpreter matches commands you type against exit names before MUSH commands.  If for example you type &quot;<TT>LO</TT>&quot; to look around, you'll go through the &quot;<TT>LO</TT>&quot; exit instead!
<P>
&quot;<TT>IN</TT>&quot; is an unfortunate case, since it seems to be a perfect complement to &quot;<TT>OUT</TT>&quot;.  Avoid it just the same.<P></LI>

<LI>If you have an exit alias which is not derivable from the rules described previously, then include the alias name in angle brackets &quot;<TT>&lt;&gt;</TT>&quot; as part of the full name:
<P>
<TT>&nbsp; &nbsp; @name &lt;exit&gt; = Oak Door &lt;Gate&gt;;Oak;OD;Gate</TT>
<P>
In fact, the above example is not sufficient.  If you have a full name which includes an alias in &quot;<TT>&lt;&gt;</TT>&quot;, then you must also provide an alias which is the full name without the part in &quot;<TT>&lt;&gt;</TT>&quot;:
<P>
<TT>&nbsp; &nbsp; @name &lt;exit&gt; = Oak Door &lt;Gate&gt;;Oak Door;Oak;Gate;OD</TT>
<P>
The reason for this is that if the player were to type the full phrase &quot;<TT>Oak Door</TT>&quot;, it would not work if you didn't include the alias, because the name for the exit was &quot;<TT>Oak Door &lt;Gate&gt;</TT>&quot; and the MUSH parser will NOT automatically recognize &quot;<TT>Oak Door</TT>&quot; as an abbreviation!  The MUSH parser is inconsistent in this regard, since other commands like &quot;<TT>GET</TT>&quot; certainly *do* match partial strings.<P></LI>

<LI>Do NOT include an alias name in &quot;<TT>&lt;&gt;</TT>&quot; if it's an &quot;obvious&quot; abbreviation.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="Rooms"></A><DIV CLASS="hr"><HR /></DIV>
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/rooms.gif" WIDTH="103" HEIGHT="30" ALT="ROOMS">
<UL>
<LI>All rooms MUST have a description.  Normally this is in the <TT>@DESCRIBE</TT> attribute.  There is one special case where you might have the attribute in the <TT>@SUCCESS</TT> attribute instead, see <A HREF="#Tip1">TIP 1</A> for details.<P></LI>

<LI>If you set the <TT>AREANAME</TT> attribute on the room, this name will show up as your location when a player does a &quot;<TT>-who</TT>&quot;.  The &quot;<TT>-who</TT>&quot; (and other commands) will first check for an <TT>AREANAME</TT> on the room itself, and then on the ZMO for that room.  Normally <TT>AREANAME</TT> is only set on the ZMO, but you might find it convenient to override it with a local <TT>AREANAME</TT> on the room.<P></LI>

<LI>All rooms should be set <TT>TRANSPARENT</TT>, unless there is a good reason not to. What happens when a room is set <TT>TRANSPARENT</TT> is that the exits are shown with the name of the room they lead to. This makes it easier for newbies, as well as not so newbies, to find their way around. However, there may be reasons that this format may not fill the needs of the builder, for what he is trying to create. In that case, it is left to the discretion of the CW of the culture if it is used. But in general, it is a good convention to follow for the reasons above.</LI>

<TD VALIGN="top"><B>TIP 1:</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;</TD>
<TD>Making a room description which is different for a person in the room versus a person looking through an exit into the room.</TD>
</TR></TABLE>
<P>
Usually, when looking through a tranparent exit, you are trying to see who is in the target room, and not the full description of the room itself. Here's a building trick for you which makes this easy to do, based on the following two items:
<UL>
<LI><P>If you have <TT>@DESCRIBE</TT> and <TT>@SUCCESS</TT> on rooms, a player in the room will see both the <TT>@DESC</TT> and <TT>@SUCC</TT> messages (in that order).<P></LI>

<LI><P>If you have <TT>TRANSPARENT</TT> exits looking into a room, then when a player looks through the exit, they will see only the room's <TT>@DESC</TT>.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Put the room's description in the <TT>@SUCC</TT> instead of the <TT>@DESC</TT> attribute. Then, players looking through an exit into the room will not see the room description, but players in the room itself will.  In the description for the exit itself you can put a shortened description of the target room. Players looking through the exit will see the short description (which is really the exit's description but will look like the target room's description instead), followed by the contents of the room.
