<P>
The administrators of this MUSH are the ones who work both in the cultures and on a global level to keep this MUSH running as smoothly as possible and to support players to make RP as easy and interesting as possible for them. The admins on the MUSH do their work voluntarily, they do not get paid for their work. They work as admins here simply because they want to improve the environment that they play in themselves, and their only reward is to see that their work is successful, or of course a pat on the back from others who appreciate their work.
<P>
For a description of the duties and responsibilites of MUSH admins, read <A HREF="#Duties">Duties</A>.
<P><BR>
<A NAME="Conduct"></A>
<IMG SRC="images/conduct8.gif" WIDTH="110" HEIGHT="30" ALT="CONDUCT">
<P>
Beleriand admins of all levels are expected to set the example for proper conduct in our community. From the longest tenured Wizard to the newest of newbie helper Culture Support admins we all share a duty to act in a manner that is ethical, constructive, friendly and above all in a way that serves the best interests of the Beleriand community. Players will look up to you, seeing in you an example of proper behaviour in Beleriand, both IC and OOC. It is essential to remember this, that others will follow the path you mark. A good admin inspires confidence, trust, and a desire to keep in mind the common good of the MUSH.
<P>
It is worth taking a moment here to talk a little about interaction with players. Admins must remember that they have a tremendous amount of authority and control over the MUSH lives of the Beleriand players. When dealing with a player in an official capacity it is vital that admins demonstrate a professional demeanor that should include patience, consideration, courtesy and above all a spirit of public service, rather than a display of arbitrary power. These are people on the other side of the terminals. Remember that and remember the Golden Rule when you are dealing with them.
<P><BR>
<A NAME="Duties"></A>
<IMG SRC="images/duties8.gif" WIDTH="83" HEIGHT="29" ALT="DUTIES">
<P>
There are some basic duties and responsibilities that are common to all admins, no matter if they are global or cultural admins. The most important guidelines for admins are summarized here, so if you are an admin, please follow these guidelines, all of them are important.
<P>
Your main task on the MUSH is to facilitate RP and to make the MUSH in general as easy and as interesting as possible for all players. Please understand that though you should have fun with your work, you do your work for the players. Most other guidelines here are directly derived from these rules.
<P>
Try to set a good example for the players. This means that you should try to act like you would expect it from a good player.
<P>
No matter which admin rank you have, please never forget, though your position gives you special powers, you are also still a player on the MUSH, so treat all other players or admins on lower levels like you would expect to be treated by admins on a higher level yourself.
<P>
Try to be as helpful as you can, especially with newbies. Please try to understand that new players often don't know anything about MUSHes, so do not get angry at them if they ask the same question two or three times.
<P>
Also, try to make newbies feel 'at home' here. When they page you, please try to take some time for them. It often takes new players a lot of courage to page someone for the first time, and if you are the first person they page, and the only answer they get is, 'I don't have any time for you', then you might also be the last person they page.
<P>
Try to keep track of the bulletin boards and policy changes when they are being announced.
<P>
Please tell the admins on the higher levels about all problems, suggestions, ideas and complaints that you might have. They want and need your input. And if you receive input from admins on lower levels, consider it carefully and do not just ignore it.
<P>
But never forget: Have fun with your admin work. The moment that you notice that you can not have any fun as admin anymore is probably the moment that you should give it up, though hopefully it will never come that far.
<P>
To summarize the duties of the admins on Beleriand, please remember the following: 1) As an admin you have a duty to keep the needs of the players and the game foremost in your mind. 2) The safety of the MUSH is paramount. 3) You must conscientiously fulfill the durites and responsibilities that are assigned to your position. 4) You are a player as well as an admin, so have fun and enjoy yourself. These duties will be made easier if you strive to always be aware of the most current policies governing Beleriand and work to enact those policies fairly and equitably.
<P><BR>
<A NAME="Responsibilities"></A>
<IMG SRC="images/responsibilities8.gif" WIDTH="193" HEIGHT="30" ALT="RESPONSIBILITIES">
<P>
Whatever area you are posted to handle, you should be aware that it is given to you both as a privilege and an obligation. It matters not if you are a Wizard or a Royal or a Culture Admin, you have a task to perform and if you cannot then it is your duty to say that you can't. What we cannot afford above all is stagnation; the game cannot afford for anyone to take on jobs and tasks that they cannot do. Whatever the reason is, for the fact that a job or a task cannot be done it is yours to keep for yourself, there's no shame in saying that you cannot handle a certain task and you need not tell why. In fact, if you show that you yourself know when it is time to let go of a task, then all the more credit to you for being so clear in perceiving that this work shouldn't belong with you. Speak to a higher rank admin about it and that admin will surely provide you with assistance.  Don't cling to something you know you can't handle.
<P>
On the other hand, there's no point in giving up too early either! Try, and try again. When it becomes clear after you have tried your best, then why not ask for some help? We are all in it together and none of us are capable of doing EVERYTHING there is to do. We have our weak sides, so let's help each other and improve. In a way, admins are the ones to benefit the most from MUSHing, we learn more then the players ever will. We see all the facets and all the dark and light sides of people and of MUSHing. We are a privileged few... Know when to go calling on your superiors.  If a problem arises that you have not encountered before (even though you may guess well at how it should be handled), investigate into the matter and  before any, BEFORE ANY, action is taken to repair the situation, please ask your fellow admins at your own level if something like this has happened before and what was done then. We are supposed to be fair and our judgments consistent. If there's no one to ask, or if there hasn't been a mention of this before, then drop a line to one of your superiors about the problem. If the solution is urgent and the problem has to be taken care of at once and you have none to ask, then you are on your own. Use your best common sense and try your best. Be ready to give an account of what you thought and how you reasoned, as well as what solution you applied to the problem. Your superiors are not without understanding, far from it, they know what you're going through. They'vebeen there themselves you know.
<P><BR>
<A NAME="Levels"></A>
<IMG SRC="images/levels8.gif" WIDTH="81" HEIGHT="30" ALT="LEVELS">
<P>
There are two groups of admins on Beleriand: Cultural Admins (CA) and Global Admins (GA). These groups are subdivided into several ranks. For information about these groups and the admin ranks, read the following topics.
<P><BR>
<IMG SRC="images/cultureadmin8.gif" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="30" ALT="CULTURE ADMIN (CA)">
<P>
There are six different cultural admin positions. It is left to the culture wardens to fill these positions or not. Players can be on more than one position, and there can be more than one player on all positions except the CW and CV positions, and all CAs would always do some CS work. It is left to the culture wardens to redefine the tasks and responsibilities that come with the admin positions in their cultures, though if they do so, it is their duty to inform the other CAs of their decision, otherwise the following definitions will apply:
<P>
<B>Culture Warden (CW):</B><BR>
The culture warden is the manager or governor of a culture. The CWs make all decisions about theme in their cultures, they have to approve tinyplots, they appoint or remove other cultural admins in their cultures and appoint them to their tasks. It is the CW's task to make it clear to the CAs what is expected of them, and it is the CWs task to communicate as much as possible with the CAs and the CAs have to communicate as much as possible with their CWs. The CWs are also the only ones who can decide which players get the password for their cultural builder character. It is also left to them to decide if a player can be a member of their cultures or not. The GAs will not interfere with the CWs' decisions unless there are, in the final opinion of the GAs, very good reasons.
<P>
<B>Culture Vice Warden (CV):</B><BR>
The vice warden has the full rights of the warden if either there is no warden in the culture, or the warden is not available for a longer time, for example when the warden goes on vacation, but if this is the case, then either the warden or the global admins will explicitly ask the vice warden to act as warden till the warden returns. To let others know that the CV is acting as temp CW, it is suggested that CWs set the vacation flag on themselves when they have to leave the MUSH for a longer time. If the CW is available, the CV will basically have the same rights and tasks as a normal CA, and might even have another CA position (i.e. CC, CB, CT or CS). Usually however, the CV will be the most important counsellor for the CW.
<P>
<B>Culture Coder (CC):</B><BR>
The culture coder codes and maintains the local code on the ZMO. For that, the CC should usually be able to modify the ZMO. The CC would also be the one to code objects that might be needed for RP in the culture, or it would at least be the CC's task to supervise the work on these objects, and assist the players who code them when they need help.
<P>
<B>Culture Builder (CB):</B><BR>
The culture builder not only builds things in the culture, but also supervises the building work of others, and assists where help with building is needed. The CB usually knows the password of the builder character.
<P>
<B>Culture TP-Coordinator (CT):</B><BR>
The TP coordinator's task is to come up with TP ideas or to collect them, submit them to the CW for approval, plan the TPs and coordinate them when they are running. One note: It does not mean that nobody else can work on TP ideas if there is a CT in a culture. All players should always be able to come up with TP ideas, in which case the CT would be there to offer help and counsel.
<P>
<B>Culture Support (CS):</B><BR>
The culture support admins do the day-to-day admin work, they mostly culture  new players and help them. The CS rank is not really a lower rank than CC, CT, CB and CV, all the other admins, even including the CW, would do CS work too, they just have additional responsibilities.
<P><BR>
<IMG SRC="images/globaladmin8.gif" WIDTH="222" HEIGHT="30" ALT="GLOBAL ADMIN (GA)">
<P>
The global admins usually don't involve themselves in cultural affairs, but maintain the MUSH itself. There are two different 'ranks' for global admins which differ mostly in the powers they have.
<P>
<B>Wizards:</B> The wizards can not only examine but also modify every object (including players) on the whole MUSH. It goes without saying that the wizards should use their powers wisely.
<P>
<B>Royals:</B> The powers of royals are more limited, they basically have a subset of wizard powers. They can examine all objects, but cannot modify them  unless they control them, and they can teleport anywhere. They also do not need money, and are not affected by quotas. Though they are not as powerful as wizards, they should still use their powers responsibly.
<P><BR>
<A NAME="Advancement"></A>
<IMG SRC="images/advancement8.gif" WIDTH="174" HEIGHT="30" ALT="ADVANCEMENT">
<P>
This section describes how a player becomes an admin, and how players can move up from one level to the other. Everyone should keep in mind, that being an admin is a responsibility and not a reward, and gaining admin positions or advancing to higher admin positions is not the purpose of this game. If you become an admin, it should be to work for the MUSH and the players, but not to achieve power over others. Usually, the admins who have to appoint other admins will notice if a player is doing exceptional work, and then promote the player. A good rule of thumb is that people should be promoted to a position when they are already doing the work for this position, though there are other factors that have to be considered, for example how well the new admin would fit into the existing admin team.
<P>
There are basically four different admin 'levels' to which a player can advance: Cultural Admin, Culture Warden, Royal and Wizard.
<P>
When a Culture Admin (CA) is to be appointed, the suggestion will go to the Culture Warden (CW) and the cultures CA staff, so they can all agree that the player should be raised to CA status in their culture. An ordinary player may be appointed CA if he shows a will to contribute, shows the online time, the engagement and has contributed in a special way to the gain of the culture. To what position is of course based on need and the suitability of the particular player. It is possible to have several CA's of the same type, more then one Culture Coder (CC) for instance. A Global Admin is appointed by the GA's, choosing a player who has shown him(her)self  to be able to handle the Mush topics in some special way, that player often is expert at some area to which he is appointed to handle. One does not apply to become one, one may be recommended by others to become GA or picked by the GA's and offered the chance to become one.
<P>
<B>Cultural Admin:</B> The cultural admins (CV, CC, CT, CB and CS) for a culture are appointed (and removed if necessary) by the culture warden of this culture. The CWs are totally free in their decisions, though it is suggested that they talk to their CAs before they appoint another CA, to make sure that the CAs will be able to work together as a team.
<P>
<B>Culture Warden:</B> The culture wardens are appointed only by the global admins, though they will of course listen to the opinions of the CAs in the culture. Usually, the CV will be the first choice when the CW spot has to be filled, though the GAs can also choose someone else.
<P>
<B>Royal:</B> The wizards and royals vote on new royals.
<P>
<B>Wizard:</B> The wizards vote on new wizards.
<P><BR>
<A NAME="Resources"></A>
<IMG SRC="images/resources8.gif" WIDTH="129" HEIGHT="30" ALT="RESOURCES">
<P>
Among the Global Admins (GA's) there are people who have been appointed especially for deep and solid knowledge in the fields of, Theme, Combat, RP...etc.. Make use of them! (-Admins gives you their specialities) Give them a page with any kind of question, or better yet, first use the channel that is assigned to the topic you are wondering about. You may get what you want that way, it's not all that hard to do and it saves the GA's a bit of work. They are there for you but that doesn't mean they ain't without things to do. When in doubt, page a GA.  Another service that the game provides MUSHwide are the ARBITERS, led by the Archarb's. They are assigned to solving combat RP and theme issues as judges in disputes. You have the right to consult one at anytime concerning an issue you may have. Be prepared though, it may take some time for a final decision, for often the ARB will need (and want) to consult with others.
<P><BR>
<A NAME="Resigning"></A>
<IMG SRC="images/resigning8.gif" WIDTH="114" HEIGHT="28" ALT="RESIGNING">
<P>
This can occur if you as an admin are inactive, if a admin behaves wrongly and won't respond to correction, if an admin abuses his privileges, or if an admin cannot handle his job. It does not matter if it was by intent or not if the admin does not change after repeated warnings. Removing an admin from a post is something that no one is pleased about; it is not a plesant thing to do. A thing that hopefully never needs to be done. But it will be done if needs be for the best of the MUSH!  There is no excuse not to pay heed to warnings which have been received repeatedly, any admin will first be asked why and what he is doing in a nice way, what then is heard will perhaps lead to a kind warning, then a more severe warning, followed by a final word. Then, demotion. The stability of the MUSH is paramount, we are here for the MUSH and it's hundreds of players...not for the amusement of the admins. Complaints from any Admin who deems himself being treated unfairly will be listened to and examined, just as any player's complaints will be examined as well.

<P>
Note: this is an admin level topic and involves some coding knowledge. If you are not an admin and this makes no sense to you, don't worry about it.  If you are a local admin but don't work with coding in your area, you also don't need to worry about it.
<P>
Every player has a "zone" which is set automatically for them when they join a culture; the "-culture" command takes care of this.  The zone is actually a regular object in itself, commonly called a "Zone Master Object" or ZMO. For details on what zones are and how they work, see "HELP ZONE OBJECTS". We will assume here that you know what ZMO's are, and how to put attributes and locks on objects.
<P>
Our cultural ZMO's have multiple purposes.  One use is a place to code "local" commands which are only available to members of a particular culture.  Coding at this level is performed at the discretion of the admins of the particular culture.
<P>
An important usage of player zones on Beleriand is to provide some information about a culture to the system, for use by the various "global" commands. Every culture MUST have a cultural ZMO.  The following things need to be done to make an acceptable cultural ZMO:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The ZONE LOCK on the ZMO needs to be secure.  The zone lock would normally include the CW of that culture, and perhaps a couple of other people trusted with building and coding culture-wide.  It is possible but not required that all the LA's for that culture will be on the lock. It is also possible to have no one at all on the lock (ask a wizard to help with this if necessary).
<P>
<LI>The attribute NEWBIE_TITLE *should* be set on the ZMO.  The value of this attribute will be put in a players &amp;TITLE attribute when they are -culture'd.  If this attribute does not exist, the title will default to "Citizen".
<P>
<LI>The attribute NEWBIE_WELCOME should be set on the ZMO.  The text in this attribute will be displayed to a player when they are -culture'd. The message should give give the new player a few hints to get started, such as the name of a local help command.  It needs to be fairly short though for the benefit of players with small terminals, no scrollback etcetera.  Maximum length of 20 lines (78 chars per line).
<P>
<LI>The attribute NEWBIE_HOME should be set on the ZMO.  This value needs to be the dbref# of the room where you want new members of the culture @link'ed for their initial home location.  Players will be automatically @link'ed to this room.  Typical locations would be a "barracks" or "guest room" or somesuch.
<P>
<B>Important:</B>  The NEWBIE_HOME room must *also* have its zone set to the cultural ZMO.  This might be different than all the zones for all the rest of the rooms in the culture, but is done as a safety check to make sure that players don't get linked to a room which doesn't belong to their culture.
<P>
<LI>The attribute CULTURE_CHANNEL should be set on the ZMO.  This value is the name of a -com channel which the player will automatically be joined to when they are -culture'd.
</UL>
<P><BR>
<A NAME="Recruiting"></A>
<IMG SRC="images/recruiting8.gif" WIDTH="137" HEIGHT="30" ALT="RECRUITING">
<P>
First of all it should be said that recruiting should not be a competition between the cultures. Try to find out if a new player will really be happy in your culture, or else we might lose new players from the MUSH when they find out that they are not having fun. It will help your culture more to show new players how to join another culture where they might be more happy and where they will RP, than dragging newbies into your culture when this is not the place where they can find the RP that they were looking for. This does not mean that you can't try to make your culture look good, but the helpful recruiter will usually be the most successful recruiter, even if being helpful means that you have to help newbies who decide to go to other cultures. Helping new players will always pay off in a way, no matter if the new players join your culture or not.
<P>
Also, try to be patient. On a MUSH, it is not 'The early bird catches the worm', but 'The early recruiter scares them off'. Please don't page newbies before they join the &lt;Newbie&gt; channel, unless they page you and ask for help. Many new players are very insecure at first when they join a MUSH, and it might scare them off if they get a lot of pages right after they connect, especially since they might not know how to page yet. Also, when they are on the &lt;Newbie&gt; channel, try to be polite and not too spammy.
<P>
Anyone can understand a player/admin wanting to recruit more people for his culture. Every culture should advise it's players on how the correct ways of recruiting are done.   First of all, be very patient. To a newbie this is very confusing stuff, try and add as little as possible to that confusion. If there are other players talking in the same room please page them (so as not to disturb the newbie) and try and get them to understand that spam is not what the newbie needs. Clear, concise, precise answers. Be gentle and warm towards him/her, no point in being anything else. And DO NOT brag and boast about your culture (Your culture might be wonderful but don't irritate and offend with your views, instead impress and ask the newbie to come see for him/herself instead), HELP the newbie find a home, ANY home, in which he/she can be happy.
<P>
There is absolutely no point in recruiting someone that will be unhappy with your culture. Far better to talk awhile to the newbie and try and figure out what the newbie really wants to do here...what kind of character he wants to play and what race, what he/she would like to do in Beleriand...and so on. The newbie doesn't need a sales rap, he needs HELP! Confusing newbies is a good way to get tagged as a troublemaker, don't try and recruit newbies if you know you have a problem being clear in what you say...  As an admin of your culture you are to look out for people who have a known trouble recruiting newbies and restrain those efforts and redirect their energies. Your culture gains by it, the mush gains by it. Be gentle, for the players that are trying to recruit only wants the best for the culture, even if they fail.
<P>
This is what you should do, or something that's close to this when a newbie comes on and doesn't know what to do. LISTEN first, ALWAYS listen to the newbie.  Ask if he/she needs some help or information, that you are willing to help out should he/she want it. Ask if he/she has any cultures in mind to join. If the newbie doesn't want help, leave him/her alone with the offer to talk anytime, especially about your home culture. IF he/she is uncertain about what to do, talk some more about what the newbie wishes to do on Bel, what type of race and character he/she wishes to play. Try and find out his/hers interests and skills. If you find he likes beards, loves axes and hates orcs recommend the newbie to become a dwarf. You get the picture? Don't try and sweet-talk the newbies, support them and enlighten them on what your home culture is, what the possibilities are there and by all means, be friendly and very patient. If they want to talk about the rest of Bel then do so. We are players on the mush first and foremost. When the MUSH gains a new playes so do we, if we get one to our culture then double is the joy.
<P>
If the newbie wants to join then bring him/her to your home and show him/her around. Tell the newbie about the regular help and -help files, the local help-files, about the -mail system (be sure he/she at least understands how to access it thru -help -mail) and also about the bulletin boards. (And how to access those...-skim, -read and so on. The local-BB, Public-BB are the most important.) Try to spread this information out, ask him/her how long time they have and give the information piece-meal. Ask them to write it down. Tell the newbie that if he/she does want to join they'll have to wait until a CA can -culture them. Warn them that they will not be able to participate in any IC events until they have (either done these things that are listed here or fulfilled your cultures own list of things to do) made a desc for themselves, made up a background story (neither of these need be very long but both has to be approved of by a CA before the newbie can go RP) and they have to find a suitable job.

Your newbie help inside the cultures MUST be excellent, your newbie supply must be treated delicately...it's worth more than gold. If you as a culture are to live on you have to rely on new players to come in. Good newbie help is thus VITAL! Imagination, creativity...come on! Make your newbie help more than 3 pages of dreary looking information...don't bore the newbie into quitting the game. Bind his/her interest fully with fun and interesting things to do...offer them plenty of choices, make their entry into the game as smooth as you possibly can. Helping newbies is the number one priority! Try and understand them and for the best of the MUSH, try and spread good ideas around. This is not the time to sit back and enjoy bright ideas inyour own culture, we will benefit on the whole, by gaining more players all over the MUSH, rather then getting only the tenth player that happens to find it's way to your great idea. Share! If all do the same, then there will be a time when a newbie can come online and with a little bit of energy be RPing as a full player inside a few days time!
