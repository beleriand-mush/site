The following are the Wizards of Beleriand. These are the players primarily responsible for the global administration of the MUSH, that is, overseeing the entire game, global code, anything outside or above the authority of the cultures, and in general making sure that the game runs smoothly and is a fun place for all.

<P>
The Local Admins (LAs) are many and are each responsible for taking care of a certain aspect of the game. Their jobs generally include local coding, building, and TP coordination. There are two kinds of LAs: Culture Admins (CAs) and Area Admins (AAs).
<P>
Culture Admins are responsible for running their culture (or realm). CAs are perhaps the most vital administrators, as they are the ones who greet and help new players, set them up for roleplay, and also run a lot of the roleplay and tinyplots that this game is about. Their duties also include most of the building, the creation of our world. Each culture's CA team is led by the Culture Warden (CW), which wield ultimate authority over the administration of the culture. The list of cultures and their Wardens can be found on the <A HREF="realms.html">Realms page</A>.
<P>
Area Admins are a group of admins above the culture level that administrate a portion of Beleriand and oversee the realms within them. There are four areas:

<P>
As with cultures, each area has its Warden (AW) and Admins (AAs). AWs are generally Wizards, and are in charge of appointing CWs.
<P>
The lists of Local Admins change frequently. Connect to Beleriand and type ``<TT>-help adm</TT>'' for instructions how to get their current list.
